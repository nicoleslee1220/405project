Dredge the fish fingers in the flour mixture, shaking excess into the bowl so just a light coating remains; dip in the eggs and turn to coat evenly; then dredge in the panko, turning several times to coat evenly.  (This can be a messy job...it's best to use one hand for the flour and eggs and the other for the panko.) Set the breaded tilapia fingers on the prepared baking sheet and season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to cook (this can be done several hours ahead of time).Line a plate with 3 paper towels and set by the stove. Coat a large non-stick saut pan generously with olive oil and place over medium heat. When the pan is hot, place the first batch of tilapia fingers in the pan (do not crowd) and cook until the first side is golden brown, 2-3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until done, about 2 minutes more.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","localizedName":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":15261,"name":"tilapia","localizedName":"tilapia","image":"raw-tilapia.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","localizedName":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":10018079,"name":"panko","localizedName":"panko","image":"panko.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","localizedName":"egg","image":"egg.png"},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"dip","localizedName":"dip","image":""}],"equipment":[{"id":404765,"name":"aluminum foil","localizedName":"aluminum foil","image":"aluminum-foil.png"},{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","localizedName":"baking sheet","image":"baking-sheet.jpg"},{"id":405895,"name":"paper towels","localizedName":"paper towels","image":"paper-towels.jpg"},{"id":404794,"name":"stove","localizedName":"stove","image":"oven.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Transfer the fish fingers to the plate with paper towels and let sit for a minute to drain any excess oil.","ingredients":[{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405895,"name":"paper towels","localizedName":"paper towels","image":"paper-towels.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Remove any brown bits out of the pan, add more oil if necessary and continue to cook the fish in batches until done.
