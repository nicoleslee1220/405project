I prefer the boiling method because it's more efficient - cover the beets with water, bring to a boil, and simmer for 30 minutes or until beets can easily be pierced through with a fork. Alternatively you can wrap the beets in aluminum foil and bake them in the oven at 400F for an hour or until done. After cooking, allow the beets to come to room temperature and remove their peels. Slice or quarter them.
