[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"The amount of ingredients depends on how many people you are serving and how much salad you intend to serve them.  The important thing is that this is a good blend of flavors.  I didn't try tossing this salad; each plate was composed individually.The dressing for three individual salads was 1/4 cup of olive oil, 1/2 lemon, 1/4 teaspoon of powdered mustard, 3/4 teaspoon of sugar, salt and pepper to taste.  Actually, it is all to taste.  These are only approximate measurements.Assemble the salad according to how much you want.  A handful of arugula leaves, a few beet juliennes, some crumbled goat cheese, garnish with chopped walnuts.  Use a vinaigrette salad dressing or what I've described above.","ingredients":[{"id":4135,"name":"vinaigrette","localizedName":"vinaigrette","image":"vinaigrette.jpg"},{"id":10112155,"name":"walnut pieces","localizedName":"walnut pieces","image":"walnuts.jpg"},{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","localizedName":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":11959,"name":"arugula","localizedName":"arugula","image":"arugula-or-rocket-salad.jpg"},{"id":1159,"name":"goat cheese","localizedName":"goat cheese","image":"goat-cheese.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":2046,"name":"mustard","localizedName":"mustard","image":"regular-mustard.jpg"},{"id":9150,"name":"lemon","localizedName":"lemon","image":"lemon.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","localizedName":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":11080,"name":"beet","localizedName":"beet","image":"beets.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]}]
