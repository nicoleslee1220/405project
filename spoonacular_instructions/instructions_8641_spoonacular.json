Good thing I had the salad prepared, because dinner was a #fail.Last night was one of those evenings where 5pm rolls around. Then suddenly, 5pm flashes to 6pm. Then it's 7pm and before you know it I'm still hunched over my computer at 8pm. And now suddenly I'm missing Dancing with the Stars. Gasp. Actually, maybe that's a good thing.Type, type, type. No end in site.  \"Stop working!\" my brain shouts. But I trek on into the night, forgetting about dinner, forgetting about the ticking clock and feeling oh so nice about being productive.\"It's 9 o'clock?\" .. long pause as I stare fuzzily at my screen. Click. Off. Goodbye screen, hello dinnertime.Yes indeed, I fell back on my salad. I knew I had this giant, gorgeous salad waiting in the fridge - so really, who cares what else goes with it, right? A few smoky tempeh cubes or strips on top for added protein. We also added a few light sandwiches along side this salad feast. And it was about 11pm when we finally ate dinner. But it was a nice prize for a long day of work - diving into a giant salad bowl, my day can always end on a high note!And this salad shows a lot of restraint for me. Usually I pile on the toppings - so only 4 main ingredients - was a pleasantly delicious and simple surprise.","ingredients":[{"id":16114,"name":"tempeh","localizedName":"tempeh","image":"tempeh.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"roll","localizedName":"roll","image":"dinner-yeast-rolls.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]}]}]
