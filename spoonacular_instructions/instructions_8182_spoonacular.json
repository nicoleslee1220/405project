[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Lets have some fun now. I think popping amaranth grain is one of the cutest kitchen activities one can participate in.","ingredients":[{"id":20001,"name":"amaranth","localizedName":"amaranth","image":"amaranth.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Place your best skillet on high heat and when a drop of water disappears immediately when dropped in, your skillet is ready. Pop amaranth by placing 1 tablespoon of grain in at a time, stirring constantly for about 15 seconds until seeds pop. After they pop, transfer to a bowl and add the next tablespoon of amaranth to the skillet until you get 1 cup of popped amaranth.Now, I have read that a skillet lightly greased in coconut oil also works well, but my experience has been that an un-greased skillet on high heat yields great results. So I think it depends on the pan and the range you are cooking with. Dont be discouraged if the grains dont pop right away, just adjust the temperature until you find the combination that works in your kitchen.Once all your amaranth is popped, place in a shallow bowl and set aside. Now lets create a sweet banana date paste to bind our poppers. In the blender, place banana, dates and maple syrup and mix until smooth.","ingredients":[{"id":4047,"name":"coconut oil","localizedName":"coconut oil","image":"oil-coconut.jpg"},{"id":19911,"name":"maple syrup","localizedName":"maple syrup","image":"maple-syrup.png"},{"id":0,"name":"date paste","localizedName":"date paste","image":""},{"id":20001,"name":"amaranth","localizedName":"amaranth","image":"amaranth.jpg"},{"id":9040,"name":"banana","localizedName":"banana","image":"bananas.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"grains","localizedName":"grains","image":""},{"id":9087,"name":"dates","localizedName":"dates","image":"dates.jpg"},{"id":93818,"name":"seeds","localizedName":"seeds","image":"sunflower-seeds.jpg"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":0,"name":"pop","localizedName":"soft drink","image":""}],"equipment":[{"id":404726,"name":"blender","localizedName":"blender","image":"blender.png"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Pour paste into the large bowl with the nuts and mix well.
