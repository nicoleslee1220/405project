[{"name":"Take tomatoes, apple, and garlic and place in a food processor to blend until chunky. I blended mine quite a bit and it was very soupy looking. If you dont have a processor, you can always just chop everything up! Chop up onion, green pepper, and banana and throw into slow cooker followed by the rest of the ingredients. Stir well. Cook on low for several hours. Adjust salt level to taste as it cooks, and let the house fill with the smell of curry.Optional add ins","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add unsweetened coconut, rice and raisins, or peanuts.I will admit, I was quite terrified when I saw what it looked like before mixing:Dear God what have I done???The pureed tomatoes made the sauce pinkish when it came out of the processor! Have no fear though because the curry will turn it a nice orange colour. :)This was my first time using amaranth seeds! I picked some up at bulk barn after seeing how great the nutritional profile was.In just 1/4 cup cooked seeds there is 7 grams of fibre and 7 grams of protein!I used 1/2 cup uncooked and threw it in.They are so CUTE! How could I eat them?I cooked it on medium for about 4 hours or so. The smell in the house was amazing when we got home!!!But how did it taste?I mean, lets not forget there are banana slices and apple in this curry!!!I was worried that I wouldnt like it because I have never been one to mix sweet and savoury flavours together","ingredients":[{"id":12108,"name":"unsweetened coconut","localizedName":"unsweetened coconut","image":"shredded-coconut.jpg"},{"id":20001,"name":"amaranth","localizedName":"amaranth","image":"amaranth.jpg"},{"id":11529,"name":"tomato","localizedName":"tomato","image":"tomato.png"},{"id":16091,"name":"peanuts","localizedName":"peanuts","image":"peanuts.png"},{"id":9299,"name":"raisins","localizedName":"raisins","image":"raisins.jpg"},{"id":9040,"name":"banana","localizedName":"banana","image":"bananas.jpg"},{"id":9200,"name":"orange","localizedName":"orange","image":"orange.png"},{"id":9003,"name":"apple","localizedName":"apple","image":"apple.jpg"},{"id":2015,"name":"curry powder","localizedName":"curry powder","image":"curry-powder.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"sauce","localizedName":"sauce","image":""},{"id":93818,"name":"seeds","localizedName":"seeds","image":"sunflower-seeds.jpg"},{"id":20444,"name":"rice","localizedName":"rice","image":"uncooked-white-rice.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":240,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"But wouldnt you know it this dish rocked my socks!!!!!Wow wow wow wow.
