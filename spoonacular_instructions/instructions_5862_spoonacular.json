[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Mix the oil, chili and cinnamon in a bowl large enough to fit the shrimp, preferably one that has a good lid. If you can't find ancho chili powder, you can use regular chili powder which adds garlic powder, cumin, oregano and salt to the ancho chili. But nothing wrong with an extra bit of flavor.2If you go with peeled shrimp, you can just add them to the marinade.3If you go with shrimp in the shell, I recommend a partial butterfly. Using a sharp knife, or one with a sharp serrated edge, cut through the shell along the top (back?) of the shrimp so that you cut halfway through the shrimp from the head down to the tail. This will let the marinade get in and flavor the shrimp better.","ingredients":[{"id":1022009,"name":"ancho chili powder","localizedName":"ancho chili powder","image":"chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":1022020,"name":"garlic powder","localizedName":"garlic powder","image":"garlic-powder.png"},{"id":2009,"name":"chili powder","localizedName":"chili powder","image":"chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":10211962,"name":"ancho chili pepper","localizedName":"ancho chili pepper","image":"dried-arbol-chiles.jpg"},{"id":2010,"name":"cinnamon","localizedName":"cinnamon","image":"cinnamon.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"marinade","localizedName":"marinade","image":"seasoning.png"},{"id":2027,"name":"oregano","localizedName":"oregano","image":"oregano.jpg"},{"id":15270,"name":"shrimp","localizedName":"shrimp","image":"shrimp.png"},{"id":11819,"name":"chili pepper","localizedName":"chili pepper","image":"red-chili.jpg"},{"id":1002014,"name":"cumin","localizedName":"cumin","image":"ground-cumin.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404745,"name":"knife","localizedName":"knife","image":"chefs-knife.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the butterflied shrimp to the marinade.4Put on the lid, or a healthy few layers of plastic wrap and shake to get all the shrimp covered.
