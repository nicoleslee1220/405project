It sounds like a chore but it doesn't take that long and they are easy to find  all neatly arranged in a straight line with the ends sticking up for easy grabbing.Toast the flaked almonds in a non-stick pan over moderate heat until they are starting to turn brown at the edges  watch them closely though because they burn easily!Bring a large pot of fresh water to a rapid boil, dump the drained samphire in it and turn off the heat.","ingredients":[{"id":15114,"name":"trout fillets","localizedName":"trout fillets","image":"trout.png"},{"id":99282,"name":"samphire","localizedName":"samphire","image":"mixed-vegetables.png"},{"id":12061,"name":"almonds","localizedName":"almonds","image":"almonds.jpg"},{"id":18070,"name":"toast","localizedName":"toast","image":"toast"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"},{"id":404752,"name":"pot","localizedName":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}],"length":{"number":270,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Heat enough butter to generously cover the base of your frying pan. Lightly dust the fish fillets with flour and when the butter is bubbling lay them, skin-side down, in the pan. Cook for a minute or so, until the edges are pale pink and the centre of the fillet is still coral-coloured. Flip them over and cook for a further 30 seconds.Plate the trout and drizzle each fillet with the butter left in the pan as well as a squirt of lemon juice. Top each fillet with toasted almonds and serve beside the samphire. You can drizzle the samphire with butter, but I just gave mine a squirt of lemon juice. While all this was going on, I also roasted some new potatoes in the oven with olive oil, garlic and rosemary  you can see them in the background of my picture.See what some other bloggers had to say about samphire here and here and here and here.More deliciousness for you!Pan-fried salmon on kale, sweet potato and pomegranate","ingredients":[{"id":10115261,"name":"fish fillets","localizedName":"fish fillets","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"},{"id":10211352,"name":"new potato","localizedName":"new potato","image":"new-potatoes.jpg"},{"id":11507,"name":"sweet potato","localizedName":"sweet potato","image":"sweet-potato.png"},{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","localizedName":"lemon juice","image":"lemon-juice.jpg"},{"id":1009286,"name":"pomegranate","localizedName":"pomegranate","image":"pomegranate.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":2036,"name":"rosemary","localizedName":"rosemary","image":"rosemary.jpg"},{"id":99282,"name":"samphire","localizedName":"samphire","image":"mixed-vegetables.png"},{"id":12061,"name":"almonds","localizedName":"almonds","image":"almonds.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","localizedName":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","localizedName":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":15076,"name":"salmon","localizedName":"salmon","image":"salmon.png"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","localizedName":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":0,"name":"trout","localizedName":"trout","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"base","localizedName":"base","image":""},{"id":11233,"name":"kale","localizedName":"kale","image":"kale.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Spicy salmon fillets with fresh herb salsa","ingredients":[{"id":10115076,"name":"salmon fillets","localizedName":"salmon fillets","image":"salmon.png"},{"id":6164,"name":"salsa","localizedName":"salsa","image":"salsa.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Baked pattypan squash steaks with cheese and herbs","ingredients":[{"id":11475,"name":"pattypan squash","localizedName":"pattypan squash","image":"pattypan-squash.png"},{"id":1041009,"name":"cheese","localizedName":"cheese","image":"cheddar-cheese.png"},{"id":23232,"name":"steak","localizedName":"steak","image":"ribeye-raw.jpg"},{"id":1002044,"name":"herbs","localizedName":"herbs","image":"mixed-fresh-herbs.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Baked salmon fillets with smashed olives, flat leaf parsley and garlic","ingredients":[{"id":10311297,"name":"flat leaf parsley","localizedName":"flat leaf parsley","image":"parsley.jpg"},{"id":10115076,"name":"salmon fillets","localizedName":"salmon fillets","image":"salmon.png"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","localizedName":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":9195,"name":"olives","localizedName":"olives","image":"olives-mixed.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]}]
