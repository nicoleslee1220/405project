Be careful not to overcrowd the dough or you'll have a hard time sealing the raviolis properly. Use a pastry brush to paint the egg wash all around the filling. Drape the other piece of dough over the first piece and use your fingers to start sealing each ravioli starting from one end. It's crucial that there aren't any air pockets with the filling as the air will expand while cooking and your ravioli will burst. The best way to do this is to seal one side, then use two fingers to trace the outline of the filling starting fromt he side that's sealed, then seal off the other side, and you should be good.I used a round cookie cutter that's 1/4\" bigger than the filling mound on both sides, but you can also cut your ravioli with a knife. If you are freezing the ravioli, place them on a floured cookie sheet and freeze them. Once they are frozen you can put them in a ziplock bag, but they will stick together if you don't freeze them separately first.To cook the ravioli, bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil, then turn down the heat to maintain a gentle boil. If you have a very large pot you can cook all 18 at the same time, but I just cooked them in two batches. Drop the raviolis in and then they float to the surface they are done (this won't take very long).","ingredients":[{"id":93832,"name":"ravioli","localizedName":"ravioli","image":"ravioli.png"},{"id":10118192,"name":"cookies","localizedName":"cookies","image":"shortbread-cookies.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"dough","localizedName":"dough","image":"pizza-dough"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","localizedName":"egg","image":"egg.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":221429,"name":"cookie cutter","localizedName":"cookie cutter","image":"cookie-cutters.jpg"},{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","localizedName":"baking sheet","image":"baking-sheet.jpg"},{"id":404764,"name":"pastry brush","localizedName":"pastry brush","image":"pastry-brush.jpg"},{"id":404745,"name":"knife","localizedName":"knife","image":"chefs-knife.jpg"},{"id":404752,"name":"pot","localizedName":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":13,"step":"Drain the ravioli and transfer them to a bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":93832,"name":"ravioli","localizedName":"ravioli","image":"ravioli.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":14,"step":"Drizzle with sesame oil, add a handful of arugula, and sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss to coat.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","localizedName":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":4058,"name":"sesame oil","localizedName":"sesame oil","image":"sesame-oil.png"},{"id":11959,"name":"arugula","localizedName":"arugula","image":"arugula-or-rocket-salad.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":15,"step":"Serve the ravioli with the balsamic vinegar reduction.","ingredients":[{"id":2069,"name":"balsamic vinegar","localizedName":"balsamic vinegar","image":"balsamic-vinegar.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"reduction","localizedName":"reduction","image":""},{"id":93832,"name":"ravioli","localizedName":"ravioli","image":"ravioli.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":16,"step":"Sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds and chives on top to garnish.","ingredients":[{"id":12023,"name":"sesame seeds","localizedName":"sesame seeds","image":"sesame-seeds.png"},{"id":11156,"name":"chives","localizedName":"chives","image":"fresh-chives.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]}]
