I recommend cooking the corn in the husks for the added flavor that the husks impart.  If you boil or steam the corn ears after you've already husked them, or if you cook them in the microwave, reduce the cooking time by a few minutes.2 To remove the kernels from the cobs, stand a corn cob vertically over a large, shallow bowl.  Use a sharp knife to make long, downward strokes, removing the kernels from the cob, as you work your way around the cob.  Note: it may help to work over a low table, to be in a better ergonomic position to cut the cobs this way. 3 In a medium sized bowl, mix together the corn, chopped arugula, bacon, and onions.
