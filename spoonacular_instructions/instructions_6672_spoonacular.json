Into the braising pan the sauce goes, followed by Swordfish fillets topped with a yummy herb/bread crumb mixture. The whole thing gets baked together, and then served with the sauce ladled on top of the fish.Holy cow! This sauce is something to write home about! The combination of briny capers and olives, spicy chili flakes, sweet currants and rich pine nuts sets off a chain reaction of flavor that will have you licking your bowl. The Swordfish with the bread crumbs is also fabulously moist and meaty, and goes amazing with the sauce.
