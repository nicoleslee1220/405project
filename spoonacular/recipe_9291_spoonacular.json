Put the beets in a glass baking dish (8x8-inch works well). Drizzle them with the oil and 2 Tbs. water. Seal the pan tightly with aluminum foil and roast the beets until just soft enough to pierce with a fork, 50 to 55 min. Transfer the beets to a cutting board. When cool enough to touch, rub off their skins with paper towels and quarter them lengthwise (or cut them into sixths if they seem large).    Put the remaining ingredients and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil.    If quick pickling, pack the beets in a 2-qt. heat-resistant glass bowl or measuring cup. Pour the hot brine over the beets. Let cool to room temperature and then cover and refrigerate for at least 2 and up to 14 days.    If canning, pack the beets into clean, hot pint jars. Pour the hot brine over the beets, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. If you have extra brine, strain it and distribute the solids among the jars. Process for 10 minutes, following the directions in our \"Canning Basics\" guide. Store the pickles for at least 2 but preferably 7 days (or longer) before opening. Refrigerate after opening.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Size                        :                      based on 4 oz. serving, Calories                        (kcal):                      60, Fat                        (kcal):                      0, Fat Calories                        (g):                      0, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      0, Protein                        (g):                      2, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      0, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      14, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      0, Sodium                        (g):                      300, Cholesterol                        (g):                      0, Fiber                        (g):                      2,                     Photo: Scott Phillips          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat the oven to 400F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":400.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Put the beets in a glass baking dish (8x8-inch works well).","ingredients":[{"id":11080,"name":"beet","localizedName":"beet","image":"beets.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":406921,"name":"glass baking pan","localizedName":"glass baking pan","image":"glass-baking-tray.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Drizzle them with the oil and 2 Tbs. water.
