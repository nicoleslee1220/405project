Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Ziobaffan Organic Pinot Grigio.

In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, mustard, horseradish, and capers; stir until well blended.    In another small bowl, combine the paprika, thyme, oregano, garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/8 tsp. pepper. Brush the swordfish with 1 tsp. of the oil. Spread equal amounts of the paprika mixture onto both sides of the swordfish and let sit for 10 minutes.    In a large cast-iron or heavy-duty skillet, heat the remaining 2 tsp. oil over medium-high heat until very hot. Add the swordfish and cook until well browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip the swordfish and continue to cook until the fish is cooked through (cut into it to check) and the second side is well browned, another 3 to 5 minutes. Serve with the rmoulade sauce.
