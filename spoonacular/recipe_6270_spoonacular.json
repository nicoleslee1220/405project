Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Rabble Pinot Gris with a 4.9 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

When its warm, add the onion, fennel, leek, and garlic and-saut over medium heat until tender, about 10 minutes. Add the fennel seeds, tomatoes, sherry vinegar, and sugar and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the tomatoes have broken down and the flavors have developed, about 45 minutes.                                                    Pass the mixture through a food mill or puree using a hand or regular blender or food processor. For an ultra-smooth puree, strain through a fine sieve, if desired. Return the sauce to the pan and season with salt and pepper; cover to keep warm.                                                    Cook the potatoes in a small pot of boiling salted water until tender. Drain and cover to keep warm.                                                    Meanwhile, in a medium saut pan just large enough to hold the fennel in one layer, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium heat. Add the fennel, along with a tablespoon of water, season with salt and pepper, and cook, turning once, until tender, about 12 minutes. Transfer the fennel to a bowl, add the fingerling potatoes, and season with a little salt and pepper. Toss with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and cover to keep warm.                                                    Heat a saut pan just large enough to hold the snapper over medium-high heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season the fish with salt and white pepper. Place skin side up in the pan and cook until the edges begin to turn opaque, about 4 minutes. Turn and continue cooking until just done (a knife inserted into the thickest part of the fish should reveal a pearly opaqueness), about 4 minutes more.                                                    Meanwhile, reheat the tomato sauce over medium heat. Whisk in the extra virgin olive oil and the orange zest.                                                    Spoon the sauce onto individual serving plates. Top with the warm fennel and fingerling potatoes and then the fish.
