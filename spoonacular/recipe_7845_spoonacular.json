Try pairing with Merlot, Pinot Noir, and rosé Wine. Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. The Matanzas Creek Alexander Valley Merlot with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 28 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":483162,"title":"Matanzas Creek Alexander Valley Merlot","description":"A medium purple color.
