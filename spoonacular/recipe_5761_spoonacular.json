Simmer over moderate heat for 5 minutes, then drain. Thinly slice 1 of the sausages and finely chop the other.                                              In a medium bowl, blend the butter with the scallions, pimentn and chopped chorizo and season with salt.                                              In a large skillet, cook the sliced chorizo over very low heat until the fat is rendered, about 4 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook over moderate heat until barely pink, about 2 minutes per side. Add the brandy, tip the skillet and, using a long match, carefully ignite the brandy. When the flames die down, add the chorizo butter and cook, stirring, until just melted, about 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the water to make a creamy sauce.                                              Transfer the shrimp and sauce to a shallow serving dish and garnish with the lemon wedges. Serve at once with crusty bread.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small saucepan, cover the chorizo with water and bring to a boil.
