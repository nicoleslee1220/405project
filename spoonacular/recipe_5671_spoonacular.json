And as the saying goes, from the frying pan to the fire, I immediately jumped into a bunch of family obligations back in Colorado. Fortunately, I cooked and photographed some recipes prior to the trip so Ill share them now until I can get back into the kitchen. First up is this simple oven baked shrimp scampi. Start by laying shrimp in a single layer of a baking dish and covering with minced garlic and parsley.Next cover with breadcrumbs and Parmigiano cheese, then drizzle with melted butter.Bake until the shrimp are just cooked through, about 10 minutes.Youll know they are done because the shrimp will have turned white and the cheese will be melted  not to mention the garlic aroma wafting through your kitchen!You can eat the scampi plain, or serve them over pasta with a simple sauce of lightly heated fresh tomatoes like I did.
