To test if the oil is hot enough, use tongs to hold one shrimp by the tail and submerge it in oil; if it sizzles and crackles, its ready. Working in batches so as not to crowd the pan, add the shrimp to the hot oil and fry, turning once, until golden brown. It should take between 40-60 seconds per side; if the shrimp are browning too quickly, turn the heat down a bit.  Use a slotted spoon to transfer the shrimp to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.  Arrange the shrimp on a platter and serve with the Sweet Red Chili Sauce.Note: I like to use unsweetened shredded coconut and add sugar to it, as opposed to sweetened flaked coconut, because it's healthier, much easier to work with, and adds great texture to the dish.","ingredients":[{"id":10012108,"name":"unsweetened shredded coconut","localizedName":"unsweetened shredded coconut","image":"shredded-coconut.jpg"},{"id":12109,"name":"sweetened coconut flakes","localizedName":"sweetened coconut flakes","image":"coconut-flakes.png"},{"id":6972,"name":"chili sauce","localizedName":"chili sauce","image":"tomato-sauce-or-pasta-sauce.jpg"},{"id":15270,"name":"shrimp","localizedName":"shrimp","image":"shrimp.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","localizedName":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404636,"name":"slotted spoon","localizedName":"slotted spoon","image":"slotted-spoon.jpg"},{"id":405895,"name":"paper towels","localizedName":"paper towels","image":"paper-towels.jpg"},{"id":404641,"name":"tongs","localizedName":"tongs","image":"tongs.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]}]}]
