If jumbo shrimp are not available, precook the bacon slices until just golden but still pliable, and then wrap them around the nearly done shrimp and proceed with the recipe.To make dressing: Put 1 tablespoon honey in a medium bowl. Add lemon juice and mustard; whisk to combine. Slowly pour in olive oil, whisking constantly. Season to taste with salt and pepper; set aside.To make salad: Use 1/2 teaspoon pepper to season shrimp all over. Wrap 1 piece of bacon snugly around each shrimp and secure with a toothpick running lengthwise (so shrimp can lie flat).Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Arrange shrimp in a single layer and cook, flipping once, until bacon is just crisp, about 10 minutes. Drizzle honey over shrimp and continue to cook, basting often with pan juices, until bacon is caramelized and shrimp are cooked through, about 2 minutes more. Transfer to a large plate. When cool enough to handle, remove and discard toothpicks.Arrange arugula on plates.
