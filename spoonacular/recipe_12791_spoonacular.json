Transfer the seeds to a mortar to cool, then pound to a coarse powder. In a small bowl, cover the ground fennel with 2 tablespoons of the grapeseed oil and let stand until flavorful, at least 30 minutes. Strain the fennel oil.                                               Thinly slice the fennel on a mandoline. Spread the fennel in a large, wide baking dish in an even layer. Pour the grapefruit, orange and lime juices plus 1/4 cup of the lemon juice over the fennel and refrigerate for 1 1/2 hours.                                               Drain the citrus juices into a medium saucepan and boil over high heat until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 20 minutes. Pour the juice into a bowl set in ice water and chill thoroughly. Transfer the juice to a blender and, with the machine on, slowly add the olive oil and the remaining 1 tablespoon of grapeseed oil until emulsified. Pour the dressing into a bowl, add the remaining 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.                                               In a very large bowl, toss the fennel with the endives. Add the crab and dressing and toss lightly. Season with salt and pepper and arrange the salad in a large serving bowl or on a platter. Drizzle the fennel oil all over the slaw, garnish with the parsley leaves and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small skillet, toast the fennel seeds over moderate heat until fragrant, about 40 seconds.","ingredients":[{"id":2018,"name":"fennel seeds","localizedName":"fennel seeds","image":"fennel-seeds.jpg"},{"id":18070,"name":"toast","localizedName":"toast","image":"toast"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Transfer the seeds to a mortar to cool, then pound to a coarse powder.
