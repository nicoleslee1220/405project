Add the red chili flakes (if used). Bring the  heat back up to  medium-high (the butter should be hot and golden) and  add the flour.  Keep stirring manually with a whisk for approximately 3  minutes. The  flour should absorb the butter and form a paste. Stir well  until incorporated and add the milk in  3 stages. Increase the heat  while constantly stirring for about 5  minutes. Add 4 ounces of blue cheese and  reduce the heat to low. Once the cheese is melted and well incorporated, season with salt  and pepper.  Let the sauce rest until it's time to assemble the  dish.Prepping the pears: Peel, core and cut the pears in small wedges. Place the pears in a bowl and coat them in lemon juice to prevent oxidation of the fruit and drizzle with honey and 1 tablespoon of olive oil.Assembly time:Remove the remaining blue cheese from the refrigerator 15 minutes before serving to bring it back to room temperature.On a hot, un-greased pizza stone, re-heat the flat bread,   one at a time, for about 20 seconds on each side.Spread the blue cheese bchamel sauce onto each flat  bread.
