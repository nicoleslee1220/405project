Try pairing with Merlot, Pinot Noir, and rosé Wine. Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. One wine you could try is Wild & Wilder The Exhibitionist Merlot. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":477482,"title":"Wild & Wilder The Exhibitionist Merlot","description":"The Exhibitionist is full of rich plum and damson fruit on the nose.

Arrange a row of carrots horizontally 3/4-inch to 1 1/4-inch up from the bottom of the wrap you have in front of you. Then arrange the cucumber on top of the carrot in the same way, or as best as you can as it may slip down a little. Finally, top with the slices of tuna also lying them horizontally as this makes it easy to wrap up. Roll up the wrap as tightly as you can, starting from the bottom. You want to end up with a fat Cuban cigar. Cut across the rolled wrap diagonally to make 3 pieces.                          Put the crabmeat into a bowl and add the mayonnaise, wasabi paste and oil and stir to mix. Lay the wrap in front of you and put the crabmeat in a line horizontally 2cm/about an inch up from the bottom of the wrap. Take the avocado half still with skin and scoop out the flesh in half teaspoonful curls, laying these on top of the line of crabmeat. Sprinkle over the lettuce in a neat line also, and then spritz with the lemon juice. Roll up tightly from the bottom, to form a fat cigar and then slice on an angle into 3 pieces.
