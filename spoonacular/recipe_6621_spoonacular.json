Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Menage a Trois Limelight Pinot Grigio with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

In a small stockpot, bring 3 quarts of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the artichokes and boil for about 20 minutes, or until the outer leaves pull away easily with a sharp tug. Drain the artichokes, immediately plunge them into ice and water to stop the cooking process, and then drain again.                                                     Cut the artichokes in half lengthwise, brush them lightly with 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Place the artichokes on the grill over a medium-hot fire, cut side down, and cook them for about 10 minutes, or until the cut sides are well browned. Remove the artichokes and cut each half in half.                                                     In a medium bowl, combine the artichokes, tomato, olives, parsley, garlic, red pepper flakes, olive oil, and lemon juice and mix well. Set aside.                                                     Check to be sure the fire is still at the medium-hot level. If it is not, add a bit of fuel and wait until it is caught. Rub the swordfish steaks with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste, and place on the grill. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes per side, turning only once. To check for doneness: Cut into one of the steaks; it should be just opaque throughout. Remove from the grill and serve, topped with the artichoke mixture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                var articleType_27_data = {};                    articleType_27_data.init_step_by_step_images = 0;","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut off the top third of each artichoke, snip off the sharp tips from the remaining leaves, and trim the bottom slightly so that it is even.","ingredients":[{"id":11007,"name":"artichoke","localizedName":"artichoke","image":"artichokes.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"In a small stockpot, bring 3 quarts of lightly salted water to a boil.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","localizedName":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the artichokes and boil for about 20 minutes, or until the outer leaves pull away easily with a sharp tug.","ingredients":[{"id":11007,"name":"artichoke","localizedName":"artichoke","image":"artichokes.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":20,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Drain the artichokes, immediately plunge them into ice and water to stop the cooking process, and then drain again.","ingredients":[{"id":11007,"name":"artichoke","localizedName":"artichoke","image":"artichokes.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":10014412,"name":"ice","localizedName":"ice","image":"ice-cubes.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Cut the artichokes in half lengthwise, brush them lightly with 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","localizedName":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":4669,"name":"vegetable oil","localizedName":"vegetable oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"},{"id":11007,"name":"artichoke","localizedName":"artichoke","image":"artichokes.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":6,"step":"Place the artichokes on the grill over a medium-hot fire, cut side down, and cook them for about 10 minutes, or until the cut sides are well browned.","ingredients":[{"id":11007,"name":"artichoke","localizedName":"artichoke","image":"artichokes.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404706,"name":"grill","localizedName":"grill","image":"grill.jpg"}],"length":{"number":10,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":7,"step":"Remove the artichokes and cut each half in half.","ingredients":[{"id":11007,"name":"artichoke","localizedName":"artichoke","image":"artichokes.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":8,"step":"In a medium bowl, combine the artichokes, tomato, olives, parsley, garlic, red pepper flakes, olive oil, and lemon juice and mix well.
