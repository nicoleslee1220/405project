Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"For the pasta salad dressing: Use a sealable container (such as a mustard jar, previously washed with hot soapy water). In this order, combine honey, 2 tablespoons vinegar, mustard, pickled garlic and grapeseed oil in the container. Seal the container and shake until emulsified. Mix well. Set aside.Roasting the beets:Preheat the oven to 400F.Scrub the beets under tap water. Remember to trim off a little piece from the ends of the root. Reserve the beet leaves (if any) for another dish; they're edible. Peel and cut the beets into 1\"-thick slices.Place in a large bowl.  Drizzle with about 2-3 tablespoons of canola oil. Season with salt and pepper. Toss well. Spread them on a baking sheet. Roast for about 45-50 minutes. Let the beets cool completely.Dice the beets into 1-inch cubes. Add the beets to the orzo pasta. Toss until the pasta becomes evenly pink. Drizzle with the remaining vinegar. Chill in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve.For the broccoli: Blanch the broccoli for 3-4 minutes in boiling water then transfer into  an ice bath. Drain thoroughly, then pat dry on a paper towel. Don't  over-cook, as the broccoli should still be a little crunchy. Cut into small pieces.How to prep sugar snap peas: Note: You can blanch both the broccoli and sugar snap peas at the same time.Wash the sugar snap peas. To trim them,  snap the ends between your fingers and pull out the fibrous strings on  each side of the vegetable.Boil the sugar snap peas in salted water  for about 3-4 minutes. Drain the liquid and immediately transfer to an  iced water bath. Pat dry on paper towels. Cut into thirds.Season with salt and drizzle with 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil. Set aside.Assembly time:Combine the orzo, beets, tomatoes, pickled carrots, broccoli, sugar snap peas and black beans. Add parsley. Drizzle about 3-4 tablespoons pasta salad dressing. Serve all the ingredients at room  temperature.Drizzle with more salad dressing. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
