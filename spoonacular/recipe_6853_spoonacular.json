Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Anne Amie Pinot Gris. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 14 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":447981,"title":"Anne Amie Pinot Gris","description":"Aromas of Bartlett pear, gardenia, white peach, white tea, jasmine, graham cracker, and straw.

Add the scallions and ginger and cook, stirring occasionally, until theyre just golden, with some green still visible on the scallions, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat, and with a slotted spoon, transfer the vegetables to paper towels to drain (leave the oil in the skillet). Toss the ginger and scallions lightly with salt.    Line up three wide shallow dishes. Put the flour in the first; beat the egg in the second; put the peanuts in the third. Season the tilapia fillets with salt. Dredge one fillet in the flour, shaking off the excess. Dip the fillet in the egg, then coat it with peanuts. Set the fillet on a plate and repeat with the second fillet.    Reheat the oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tilapia fillets and cook until golden on each side and the flesh is opaque and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes on each side (reduce the heat if they brown too fast). Put the tilapia on dinner plates, sprinkle with the rice vinegar and pepper to taste, top with the frizzled vegetables, and serve immediately.    Variations          Alternative coatings:Instead of peanuts, try coating the fish with cashews or sesame seeds. Or just season the fillets with salt and pepper and sear them with no coating at all.
