Drain in a colander.                                                                            Stick clove into onion.

When beans are almost done, peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch pieces.

Remove ham hocks. When ham hocks are cool enough to handle, discard skin and bones, then cut meat into bite-size pieces. Stir into soup with salt and pepper to taste. Discard bay leaf and onion.

Cooks' notes:            • Beans can be soaked up to 12 hours, chilled. • To quick-soak beans: Cover beans with cold water by 2 inches in a 5- to 6-quart pot and bring to a boil, uncovered. Boil beans, uncovered, 2 minutes, then remove from heat and let stand, uncovered, 1 hour. • Soup improves in flavor if made 1 day ahead, cooled completely, uncovered, then chilled, covered. Remove any solidified fat and reheat, thinning with water if necessary.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Soak beans in cold water to cover by 2 inches at room temperature at least 8 hours, or quick-soak (see cooks' note, below).","ingredients":[{"id":0,"name":"beans","localizedName":"beans","image":"kidney-beans.jpg"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":480,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Drain in a colander.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404639,"name":"colander","localizedName":"colander","image":"colander.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Stick clove into onion.
