Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Santa Margherita Pinot Grigio. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 26 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428588,"title":"Santa Margherita Pinot Grigio","description":"A pale straw yellow.

To make the fish: Lay the swordfish between 2 sheets of plastic wrap Using a meat mallet or the bottom of a small, heavy skillet, lightly pound the fish until it is about  inch thick. Transfer the fish to a plate, season with salt and black pepper.                                                     Preheat the oven to 400F.                                                     In a saut pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high heat. Saute the onion and garlic for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the onion is translucent. Add the bread crumbs and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove pan from the heat and stir in the parsley, thyme, capers, and red pepper. Season with salt and black pepper and set aside.                                                     Sprinkle the bread crumb mixture over the fish.
