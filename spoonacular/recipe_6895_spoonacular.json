Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Rabble Pinot Gris with a 4.9 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":452031,"title":"Rabble Pinot Gris","description":"Alsatian-inspired with notes of lime, green apple, white flower and wetstone.

Season fish on all sides with salt and pepper and place in a dish large enough to hold in a single layer.

Preheat gas grill to medium, or preheat broiler to high and set rack 6 inches from source of heat. Remove fish from marinade and grill or broil until flaky, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes, then cut into chunks.
