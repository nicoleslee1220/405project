Melt 1 tablespoon butter.                          On a baking sheet, toss the potatoes with the melted butter, 1/2 tablespoon olive oil, salt, pepper, and 1/2 tablespoon thyme. Put them in the oven for 30 minutes.                          Meanwhile, heat a large skillet and add 1 tablespoon oil. Add the chopped bacon and cook for a few minutes. You don't want to over-crisp the bacon before you add the livers. If the bacon gets too crisp before the livers go in just take it out and lay on a paper towel to drain. Season the livers with salt, and pepper, and add to the pan. We are looking for a great dark sear on each side so let the livers cook about 3 minutes per side. Put the livers on one side of pan and the bacon on the other. After the livers are cooked, add the marmalade and the remaining thyme and give it a good toss or stir. Turn off the heat and let stand. While the livers are resting, in another saute pan add 1 tablespoon oil and 1/2 tablespoon butter. Put the pan over high heat and when the butter starts to brown, add the sliced Brussels sprouts and spread out across the entire pan. Cook for 2 minutes, add salt, and pepper, and toss like a pancake or simply stir them up. The edges will start to brown and you'll get a deep nutty crispness.                          Place the Brussels sprouts down on a plate and lay the livers on top and then flank it with the new potatoes.                          To make Citrus Marmalade:                          Heat a large pot over medium heat and stir in the grapefruit sections, grapefruit peel, sugar, wine, and rice wine vinegar. Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 90 minutes or until it's nice and thick. Transfer the mixture to a food processor or blender and quickly pulse. Do not fully puree it. Keep the mixture in a jar to use with meats or desserts.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
