Try pairing with Merlot, Pinot Noir, and rosé Wine. Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. One wine you could try is Raymond R Collection Merlot. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 12 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":439335,"title":"Raymond R Collection Merlot","description":"The Merlot fills the mouth with smooth cherry, raspberry and plum flavors along with hints of earth and spice in the toasty vanilla finish.

Combine spices in a small bowl. Season tuna all over with spices and put in a 4- by 8-in. loaf pan. Chill, covered, 3 to 5 hours.                                                                                                 Preheat oven to 300. Add bay leaf, herb sprigs, garlic, and zest to tuna, tucking them around fish; pour in enough oil to cover by 1/4 in.                                                                                                 Bake tuna 25 minutes, uncovered, lowering heat if necessary to keep oil from boiling. Let tuna cool to room temperature in oil.                                                                                                 Lift one piece of tuna from oil; separate into thick flakes. Top baguette slices with tuna, using more if needed, and arrange on a platter with olives and radishes. Scatter minced parsley over platter. Drizzle tuna with some of the oil, and flick some oil onto the olives and radishes too.
