Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"1 Cook pasta:Bringa large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) to a rolling boil. Add the pasta, return to a rolling boil, and boil uncovered until the pasta is al dente, cooked, but still a little firm to the bite.2 Cook garlic and red pepper flakes in olive oil; add tuna, salt:While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet on medium-low heat. Add the garlic and hot pepper flakes and cook until garlic is fragrant. Add the tuna and shred it into fine flakes with a fork. Season with salt. Keep warm over low heat.3 Set aside a cup of pasta water:Just before the pasta is ready, set aside 1 cup of boiling water. You'll need this to add back to the pasta dish to keep it from getting too dry.4 Combine pasta with tuna mixture, arugula, and some pasta water:Drain the pasta and depending on the size of your pan, either add it to the skillet with the tuna, or return the pasta to the pasta pot and add the tuna mixture to the pasta. Add the arugula and use tongs to toss together with the pasta and tuna. Add some of the hot reserved pasta water to help loosen the pasta.The arugula will wilt as you toss the pasta and tuna with it. Add more pasta water as needed.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1 Cook pasta:Bringa large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) to a rolling boil.","ingredients":[{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","localizedName":"pasta","image":"fusilli.jpg"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","localizedName":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the pasta, return to a rolling boil, and boil uncovered until the pasta is al dente, cooked, but still a little firm to the bite.2 Cook garlic and red pepper flakes in olive oil; add tuna, salt:While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet on medium-low heat.","ingredients":[{"id":1032009,"name":"red pepper flakes","localizedName":"red pepper flakes","image":"red-pepper-flakes.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","localizedName":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","localizedName":"pasta","image":"fusilli.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":10015121,"name":"tuna","localizedName":"tuna","image":"canned-tuna.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the garlic and hot pepper flakes and cook until garlic is fragrant.","ingredients":[{"id":11819,"name":"chili pepper","localizedName":"chili pepper","image":"red-chili.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","localizedName":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the tuna and shred it into fine flakes with a fork.
