Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Maysaran Arsheen Pinot Gris. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":476600,"title":"Maysara Arsheen Pinot Gris","description":"A bright expression of fruit right up front, greeting your palate with notes of cut grass on a warm day.
