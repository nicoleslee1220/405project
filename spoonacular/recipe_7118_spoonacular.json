Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Chehalem 3 Vineyard Pinot Gris. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 26 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":435394,"title":"Chehalem 3 Vineyard Pinot Gris","description":"A blend of three great vineyards, this vivid grape crafts a food-friendly wine, bright and pure.
