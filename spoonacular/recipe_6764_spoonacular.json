Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Maysaran Arsheen Pinot Gris with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":476600,"title":"Maysara Arsheen Pinot Gris","description":"A bright expression of fruit right up front, greeting your palate with notes of cut grass on a warm day. The wine is anchored by crisp acidity, but not so much as to overpower a fleeting tease of sweetness that leaves you smiling.
