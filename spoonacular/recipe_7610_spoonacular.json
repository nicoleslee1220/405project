Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like ahi tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your ahi tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. The Rabble Merlot with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.
