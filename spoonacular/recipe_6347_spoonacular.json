Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Loveblock Pinot Gris with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":440435,"title":"Loveblock Pinot Gris","description":"Loveblock Pinot Gris is a pale golden with hints of green.

Mound the noodles over the fish and drizzle the sauce on top. Set the pie plate in a steamer basket or a deep skillet large enough to hold it. Add 1 inch of water to the steamer or skillet and bring to a boil. Cover and steam until the fish is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Transfer the plate to a trivet and scatter with the scallion and cilantro.                                              Heat the canola oil in a small saucepan until very hot. Drizzle the hot oil over the noodles and fish and serve right away.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small bowl, cover the cellophane noodles with hot water and let stand until softened, about 5 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":16082,"name":"cellophane noodles","localizedName":"cellophane noodles","image":"dry-cellophane-noodles.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Drain and cut into 4-inch lengths.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"In another small bowl, whisk the miso, oyster sauce, soy sauce, sugar and stock.","ingredients":[{"id":6176,"name":"oyster sauce","localizedName":"oyster sauce","image":"oyster-sauce.jpg"},{"id":16124,"name":"soy sauce","localizedName":"soy sauce","image":"soy-sauce.jpg"},{"id":1006615,"name":"stock","localizedName":"stock","image":"chicken-broth.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","localizedName":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":16112,"name":"miso","localizedName":"miso","image":"miso.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","localizedName":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Scatter the mushrooms in a deep-dish pie plate and set the fish on top.
