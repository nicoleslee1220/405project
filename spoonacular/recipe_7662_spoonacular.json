Season the tomato vinaigrette generously with salt.                                              Heat a grill pan and brush it with olive oil. Brush the tuna steak with olive oil and season it with salt and pepper. Grill the tuna over moderately high heat, turning, until seared on the outside but still rare on the inside, about 13 minutes. Let the tuna rest for 5 minutes, then cut into slices.                                              Meanwhile, heat 1/4 inch of olive oil in a large skillet until shimmering. Put the flour, egg and bread crumbs in 3 shallow bowls. Dip the cheese triangles in the flour, then in the egg and finally in the bread crumbs, pressing to help them adhere. Add the cheese to the hot oil and fry over moderately high heat, turning once, until golden and crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the fried Manchego on a rack and sprinkle lightly with salt.                                              Add the romaine to the vinaigrette in the bowl and toss well. Mound the dressed salad onto large plates. Arrange the tuna slices on the plates and stack the fried manchego slices alongside the salad.
