When grill reaches temperature, spray smoker grate with a high temperature cooking spray. Place onion, herbs and pats of butter (or buttery spread) inside the fish cavity. Then lay the trout directly on the smoker grate. There should be enough space between your trout so the smoke can reach all parts of the fish.Let the fish smoke for 30 minutes at 150 degrees to dry the outside of the fish so that it can be firmer in the later stages of smoking.After 30 minutes raise the temperature to 225 degrees to finish the smoking process.Smoke until the fish reaches 145 degrees.
