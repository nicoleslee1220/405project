While the pan is heating, lay the shrimp out on paper towels and pat dry. Add 2 tablespoons of the peanut oil to the pan and heat until sizzling. Add half of the shrimp to the pan (they should be in a single layer) and stir-fry (cook, stirring continuously) until just pink but not cooked through, 1-2 minutes. Transfer the partially cooked shrimp to a plate, then add the remaining two tablespoons of peanut oil to the pan and heat until sizzling; add the remaining shrimp and stir-fry as you did the first batch. When the shrimp are just pink but not cooked through, add the reserved shrimp back to the pan along with the ginger, garlic, sweet red chili sauce and jalapeo peppers; stir-fry for about 1 minute more. Add the water, soy sauce, scallions and bell peppers and cook until the shrimp are cooked through, 1-2 minutes more. Do not overcook. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the shrimp to a serving dish. Continue to cook the sauce until slightly thickened. Turn off the heat, stir in the sesame oil, and then pour over the shrimp. Serve with jasmine rice.Note:  When working with jalapeo peppers, be careful to minimize contact with the seeds. Simply cut the flesh off the seeds and stem, then chop the flesh. If you touch the seeds, wash your hands well.Note: To grate fresh ginger, first peel the skin and then rub the ginger root along a rasp or fine grater.
