This example is a wonderfully lively, intense, fruity and beautifully balanced dry Chenin Blanc. Aromas of green apples and white peach invite the juicy, yet taut palate. A depth of fruit is what sets this wine apart. It shows great persistence of flavor and freshness that linger on the palate long after the wine has gone. Very individual, the character of this wine makes it a perfect companion to warm summer days and long balmy evenings.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/504072-312x231.jpg","averageRating":1.0,"ratingCount":10.0,"score":0.967741935483871,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-winery-of-good-hope-bush-vine-chenin-blanc-2019%2F737423"}]},"instructions":"In a large glass bowl, dissolve the salt in the water. Add the cabbage, carrot and daikon. Cover with a plate. Set a sheet of plastic wrap on the plate and top with a heavy pot to keep the vegetables submerged.

Lightly rinse the vegetables in a colander, then drain. Transfer the vegetables to a clean large bowl. Add the garlic, scallions, ginger, red chiles and chile powder and toss well.                                              Tightly pack the vegetables into a wide-mouthed 1-quart jar; add enough of the reserved liquid to cover. Using a chopstick, poke out any air bubbles. Press a small bowl on top of the vegetables to keep them submerged. Cover loosely. Let stand in a cool place for 5 days, adding more reserved liquid as needed to keep the vegetables covered.                                              Discard any liquid and seal the jar.
