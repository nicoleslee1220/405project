[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"World's Easiest Roasted Tilapia, I keep making it over and over, and this dinner with the roasted Tilapia served with black bean and mango salsa was definitely a winner. Not only did the black beans look great paired with the bright yellow mango, but the flavors in this salsa went perfectly with the mild-flavored Tilapia. I'm always in favor of recipes that combine lime and cilantro, so having that added to the mix didn't hurt a bit.Mangos grow on trees, and there are more than 1,000 cultivars of mango growing in Indian, North America, South America, Central America, the Caribbean, Africa, Australia, and Southeast Asia. They are often used in chutney and mango salsa, and mangos are eaten ripe and unripe both in many parts of the world. You're probably used to seeing bright yellow fruit on mangos, but the fruit can also be orange or red, depending on the variety of mango. Whatever color, most mango varieties are sweet and juicy, and mangos are a good source of fiber, and are rich in many vitamins and minerals.
