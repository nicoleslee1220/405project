If needed, add orange juice to make 1/3 cup. Place fillets of sole in a heavy zip-lock plastic bag and pour in juice.

Cook until browned on the bottom, about 2 minutes; turn with a wide spatula and cook until other side is browned and fish is opaque but still moist-looking in center (cut to test), about 2 minutes longer. Drain briefly on paper towels; keep warm in a 200 oven.
