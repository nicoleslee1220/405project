Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Zind-Humbrecht Clos Windsbuhl Vendange Tardive Pinot Gris with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 99 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":494626,"title":"Zind-Humbrecht Clos Windsbuhl Vendange Tardive Pinot Gris","description":"","price":"$99.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/494626-312x231.jpg","averageRating":1.0,"ratingCount":6.0,"score":0.9473684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fzind-humbrecht-clos-windsbuhl-vendange-tardive-pinot-gris-2005%2F322199"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Arrange the Tilapia side by side in a lightly oiled roasting tin or ovenproof dish.Pour over the wine, then sprinkle over the chopped garlic, most of the herbs, the salad onions and seasoning to taste.Place half the butter on each fish.
