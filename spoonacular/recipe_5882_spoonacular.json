They're also healthy, featuring my signature combination of protein, fresh vegetables and whole grains. To view all of my Simple Suppers, CLICK HERE!Today's recipe is a delicious Curried Shrimp dish that can be made in one pot! I got the inspiration for this dish at the Studio City Farmers Market on Sunday, where I found a great fish vendor with fresh shrimp for sale. I also scooped up the organic bell pepper, organic cilantro and organic yellow cherry tomatoes used in this recipe! I combined these ingredients with some other great flavors, and served the resulting dish over an organic long grain brown rice. It was so delicious, that I plan to keep this recipe in my regular rotation!Note: As I've mentioned in previous postings, shrimp is both a healthy source of protein and cooks up quickly! My Diva Secret of the day is that I always keep a bag of frozen raw shrimp in my freezer to use in a pinch. It defrosts quickly and tastes delicious.Curried Shrimp with Brown Rice1 lb raw shrimp, peeled and deveined1 bell pepper, seeded and chopped1 onion, chopped2 garlic cloves, chopped1 tbsp fresh ginger1 tbsp curry powder1 cup tomatoes, chopped (I used yellow cherry tomatoes)1 cup low sodium vegetable broth or filtered water2 tbsp cilantro, chopped2 tbsp olive oilsalt & pepperrice:1 cup brown rice2 cups filtered water1 tbsp olive oilDirections:To make the rice, place the rice, water and olive oil in a pot and bring to a boil.
