Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Chehalem 3 Vineyard Pinot Gris.

Lightly butter an 8-by-12-inch gratin dish.In a saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the butter. Stir in the flour to make a roux and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes; do not let the mixture color. Gradually whisk in the milk. Increase the heat to medium and bring the mixture to a simmer, whisking frequently. Adjust the heat to maintain a low simmer and cook, whisking frequently, until thickened into a white sauce, about 10 minutes. Whisk in the 1 tsp. salt and white pepper to taste. Cover and set aside.Place the spinach in a small stockpot and set over medium heat. Cover and cook until wilted, about 3 minutes. Empty into a colander and run cold water over the spinach to cool. In small handfuls, squeeze as much water from the spinach as possible. Using a chefs knife, chop the spinach finely. Transfer to a bowl and stir in 1/2 cup of the white sauce. Season with salt and pepper.Lay the sole fillets, smooth skin side down, on a cutting board. Check the fish for bones, removing and discarding any you find. Spoon one-fourth of the spinach mixture onto the center of each fillet, and fold the 2 ends of the fillet over the top of the spinach. Using a metal spatula, transfer each fillet, seam side down, to the prepared dish.In a blender, combine all but 1/4 cup of the shrimp, the remaining white sauce, the stock and the tomato paste and puree until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and season with salt and cayenne.Pour the sauce over the sole and bake until the fish is opaque throughout, about 25 minutes. Sprinkle the remaining shrimp on top of the fish and bake for 5 minutes more. Sprinkle with chives and serve immediately.
