Pound the breasts thin to make them thin enough for rolling. To do this place a piece of plastic wrap over the chicken breast. Use the smooth side of the meat pounder to pound the piece thin.2 Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. On a clean work surface lay cutlets flat, smooth side down. Layer with arugula leaves and pieces of goat cheese in the center. Starting with the narrowest ends, roll up the chicken cutlets into a tight roulade and seal with toothpicks to keep from unrolling.3 Heat the oil on medium high in a large cast iron pan (or other non-stick oven-proof skillet). Place the chicken roulades in the pan and brown on all sides.4 Place the skillet in the oven and cook until the chicken is cooked through, about 10 to 12 minutes. Remove pan from oven (take care to not touch pan handle with bare hands!) and remove the chicken from the pan. Cover with foil and let rest for 5 minutes. Remove the toothpicks from the chicken and slice the roulades into rounds to serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1 Preheat oven to 425F.
