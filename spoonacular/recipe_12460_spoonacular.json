Beat in cheddar cheese and sourdough starter.  Slowly add cold water, bit by bit, until the dough forms a ball and becomes pliable.  Wrap the ball of dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 8 hours, then remove from fridge and allow it to warm at room temperature for about 20 minutes.  Cut the dough into four equal quarters.  Place each ball of dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper and roll it out until it forms a circle about 1/8-inch thick.Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  When the butter froths, stir in vegetables, remaining teaspoon salt, and cook them gently for 6 to 8 minutes or until they release their fragrance.  Stir in chicken and broth.  Simmer for a further 15 to 20 minutes or until liquid has largely evaporated.Take a disc of dough, and spoon approximately 1/4 of the chicken and vegetable filling and 2 tablespoons cream cheese onto 1/2 half of the disc.  Fold the other half of the dough over the filling and seal with a fork or by crimping the edges.  Continue working until all 4 turnovers have been filled.  Whisk beaten egg with a tablespoon or two of water to make an egg wash, then brush each pastry with egg wash.  Cut a small slit in the top crust of each turnover to allow for escaping steam, then bake at 375 F about 45 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.  Allow turnovers to cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a stand mixer, or by hand, stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt together, then beat in butter until the flour resembles corn meal.
