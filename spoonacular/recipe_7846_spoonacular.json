Slice the onions and tomato as thin as you can by hand and set aside. If you have a Kyocera hand slicer (remember mine is named Danton) use it to very thinly slice the radishes or use the mandoline (Robespierre).                                  Assembly: lay out a large sheet of plastic wrap on a board. Slice the loaf in half lengthwise. Put the halves on the cling wrap and scoop out enough of the crumb so that you have two canoes. Give both canoes a generous dose of your best olive oil.                                   Place a good handful of basil leaves on the first canoe.  Top this with the tuna and then the anchovies. Add tomatoes and onion in any order you would like. Finish with olives and radishes, all in a big pile. In the other canoe place the remaining basil. And turn over to cover the sandwich.                                  Wrap it all up in the cling wrap and refrigerate for a couple of hours. Great for those days when you dont want to turn on the oven. Like today for example. Put on your espadrilles.                                  *If I ever hear any of you use the term EVOO you will be permanently off the recipe list. Why? Because even though Rachael Ray has her own labled brand she doesnt even know what it Extra Virgin means. And Im flat out serious. The world must be saved from this evil woman. Lets get started! Myself, I like to use a Spanish style oil made from arbequina olives. There are now several Californial brands.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"The process: wash the basil (cress) and use a salad spinner or clean towel to get the water off.
