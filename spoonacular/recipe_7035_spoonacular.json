Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The GIFFT by Kathie Lee Gifford Pinot Grigio with a 4.8 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 15 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":482242,"title":"GIFFT by Kathie Lee Gifford Pinot Grigio","description":"GIFFT Pinot Grigio bursts with lively pear and tropical fruits, balanced by crisp acidity and an elegantly refined freshness.
