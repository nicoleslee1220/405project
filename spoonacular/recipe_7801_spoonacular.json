Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine.

In a small bowl, combine honey and mustard. Rub tuna with mixture and let marinate at room temperature, 10 minutes.                                                                                                 Use an oil-soaked paper towel to wipe grill grates. Cook tuna just until grill marks appear, 1 to 2 minutes on each side, leaving tuna rare inside. Cut each steak across the grain into 1/4-in.-thick slices.                                                                                                 In a small bowl, combine 1/3 cup olive oil, the vinegar, and lime juice. In a medium bowl, combine greens, onion, salt, pepper, oranges, avocados, and 2/3 of vinaigrette; toss to coat. Divide salad among 4 plates and arrange tuna slices on top. Serve with remaining vinaigrette on the side.                                                                                                *Look for troll- or pole-caught Pacific albacore tuna; it's more sustainably fished than longline, and the fish have lower mercury levels.
