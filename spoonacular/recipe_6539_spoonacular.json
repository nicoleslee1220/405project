Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Zind-Humbrecht Calcaire Pinot Gris with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 46 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":467219,"title":"Zind-Humbrecht Calcaire Pinot Gris","description":"Bright yellow/gold color, quite luminous. Superb smoky toasty nose, typical for this grape on limestone in Alsace (no new oak in our wines, just very long total lees contact). Some light reductive aromas that actually fit the style of dry Pinot-Gris. The palate is rich and creamy, with a velvety texture yet fully dry. It is an easy wine to drink now as there is no unnecessary weight. The finish is nice and round but fully dry. The complex limestone blend brings great acid balance and a certain weight. It should develop very nicely over the next few years.","price":"$45.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/467219-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8775000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fzind-humbrecht-calcaire-pinot-gris-2015%2F208573"}]},"instructions":"Mix all ingredients together, EXCEPT fish and melted butter.Rinse fish fillets and pat dry; Rub with butter and dip each side into bread crumb mixture.Bake in 325 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes (uncovered) until fish flakes when pressed with a fork.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Mix all ingredients together, EXCEPT fish and melted butter.Rinse fish fillets and pat dry; Rub with butter and dip each side into bread crumb mixture.","ingredients":[{"id":10115261,"name":"fish fillets","localizedName":"fish fillets","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","localizedName":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":18064,"name":"bread","localizedName":"bread","image":"white-bread.jpg"},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"dip","localizedName":"dip","image":""},{"id":1012034,"name":"dry seasoning rub","localizedName":"dry seasoning rub","image":"seasoning.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Bake in 325 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes (uncovered) until fish flakes when pressed with a fork.","ingredients":[{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}],"length":{"number":15,"unit":"minutes"}}]}],"originalId":null}
