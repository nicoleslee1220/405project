Tear the bread into pieces and pulse in the food processor with the chopped walnuts until they become coarse breadcrumbs. Transfer the breadcrumb mixture to a wide, flat dish. Stir in the chopped chives and parsley. Flatten each piece of goat cheese into a disk and season with salt. Dip each disk in the beaten egg mixture and then coat with the breadcrumbs, packing the crumbs onto each disk. When all the goat cheese has been coated, chill them in the fridge for at least 1 hour.                          Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F.                          To help facilitate the frying process, pop the disks in the freezer for 15 minutes before frying.                          Coat a large, nonstick saute pan generously with olive oil and bring to a medium-high heat. Carefully fry the goat cheese disks in the hot oil on both sides until they are golden brown and crispy, about 2 minutes per side.                          When all of the disks have been fried, keep them warm in the oven.                          Remove the oil and any burned bits from the pan and give a splash of new oil. Reduce the heat to low, add the shallots to the pan, and let them cook as the pan cools slightly. Add the Dijon and sherry vinegar to the pan and whisk to combine. Add the radicchio, arugula, and endive and season with salt. Toss to fully incorporate with the vinaigrette and to allow the salad to slightly wilt. Taste to make sure it is delicious.                          Divide the wilted salad between serving plates and top each salad with a goat cheese disk.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the goat cheese: In a food processor, pulse the walnuts until they are coarsely chopped.
