Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Santi Sortesele Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Heat oil in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then saut leek, carrot, onion, and garlic clove, stirring frequently, until vegetables are soft and well browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in wine and deglaze saucepan by boiling, stirring and scraping up any brown bits, 1 minute.

Pour through a fine-mesh sieve into a glass measure, lightly pressing on and then discarding solids. Transfer to a small saucepan. If you have more than 3/4 cup, boil strained liquid a few minutes to reduce.                                    Saut fresh mushrooms:                                        Heat butter and oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet until hot but not smoking, then saut mushrooms with salt and pepper, stirring, until just tender and golden brown, about 4 minutes. Add celery and saut until bright green and crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and keep warm, covered with foil.                                    Finish sauce and saut skate:                                        Bring broth to a simmer, then remove from heat and stir in tapioca. Let stand, covered, 10 to 15 minutes.                                                                            While sauce is standing, stir together flour and curry powder in a shallow bowl.
