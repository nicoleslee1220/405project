Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine.

Curl ribbons around fingers, and place carrot curls in a bowl of ice water.                                                                                                 Combine vinegar, juice, 3/4 teaspoon salt, chili garlic sauce, and mustard. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons sesame oil and 1 1/2 teaspoons canola oil, stirring with a whisk.                                                                                                 Heat 1 teaspoon sesame oil and 1 teaspoon canola oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle fish evenly with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper. Add fish to pan; cook 5 minutes on each side or until desired degree of doneness. Remove fish from pan.                                                                                                 Heat remaining 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil and remaining 1/2 teaspoon canola oil in pan over medium-high heat. Add onions to pan; saut 5 minutes or until lightly browned, turning occasionally.                                                                                                 Combine lettuce, bok choy, and tomatoes in a large bowl. Drain carrot curls; add carrot curls to lettuce mixture. Drizzle vinegar mixture over lettuce mixture; toss gently to coat. Arrange 1 1/2 cups lettuce mixture onto each of 4 plates. Cut each tuna steak into thin slices. Arrange 1 tuna steak and 4 onions on each serving; sprinkle each serving with 3/4 teaspoon sesame seeds.                                                                                                Wine note: What to pour with these diverse flavors? Dry ros's bold fruitiness stands up to the richness of the sesame oil, the impact of chili sauce, and the density of tuna. I love Ctes-du-Rhne ross from France. In particular, the 2006 Domaine de la Janasse Ctes du Rhne Ros is fantastic with this dish ($14).
