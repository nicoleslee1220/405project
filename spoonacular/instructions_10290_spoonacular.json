Rub the pork with 1 teaspoon of the oil and season with the oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. In a bowl, toss the broccoli rabe with the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil and 1/4teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Grill the pork, covered, turning occasionally, until cooked through, 18 to 22 minutes. Fifteen minutes into the cooking, place the broccoli rabe and lemons on the grill. Cook, turning, until the broccoli rabe is tender and the lemons are charred, 6 to 7 minutes. Fluff the couscous and mix in the pistachios. Slice the pork and serve with the broccoli rabe and lemons. Tip: Grilling lemons intensifies the flavor of the juice, making it slightly smoky and more complex. Try grilling lemons alongside fish or chicken.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","localizedName":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":11096,"name":"broccoli rabe","localizedName":"broccoli rabe","image":"broccoli-rabe.jpg"},{"id":12151,"name":"pistachio nuts","localizedName":"pistachio nuts","image":"pistachios.jpg"},{"id":20028,"name":"couscous","localizedName":"couscous","image":"couscous-cooked.jpg"},{"id":5006,"name":"whole chicken","localizedName":"whole chicken","image":"whole-chicken.jpg"},{"id":2027,"name":"oregano","localizedName":"oregano","image":"oregano.jpg"},{"id":9150,"name":"lemon","localizedName":"lemon","image":"lemon.png"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","localizedName":"pepper","image":"pepper.jpg"},{"id":1019016,"name":"juice","localizedName":"juice","image":"apple-juice.jpg"},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"},{"id":10010219,"name":"pork","localizedName":"pork","image":"pork-tenderloin-raw.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"},{"id":1012034,"name":"dry seasoning rub","localizedName":"dry seasoning rub","image":"seasoning.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404706,"name":"grill","localizedName":"grill","image":"grill.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}],"length":{"number":24,"unit":"minutes"}}]}]
