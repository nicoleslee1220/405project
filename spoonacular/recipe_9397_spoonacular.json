Peel 4-5 beets.  (I recommend that you wear some gloves while peeling your beets otherwise you will have purple stained hands for the rest of the day.)  Quarter them and put them on the tin foil.  Drizzle them with some olive oil and a generous dose of kosher salt and fresh ground pepper.  I had some fresh rosemary so I added some chopped rosemary as well.  Fold up the tin foil to make a purse and put in a 400 degree over for about an hour.  They are done when you can stick a knife in one and get no resistance.Put the lid on and shake it really well.  Open the jar and add anywhere from  to  cup olive oil.  I like a more vinegar-y dressing.  Use the amount that tastes good to you.  Put the lid back on and shake again.  You can keep this in the fridge and just shake it up again before you use it.  It would be great on just about anything.I had some spinach in the house so that is what I used for this salad.  Please, I beg you, make sure to season your leaves before you dress them.  It makes a really big difference.Add some of the dressing and toss.  I do not like a salad heavy on the dressing.  I like the leaves to just glisten from the oil and vinegar.  Add the roasted beets on top.  I had some blue cheese and walnuts leftover from the Blue Cheese Bacon dip so I put them on as well.  This was a perfect dinner salad.  The beets are hearty enough to make it a meal.  Some good crusty bread and it is done.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Grab a piece of heavy tin foil and fold it in half.  Peel 4-5 beets.
