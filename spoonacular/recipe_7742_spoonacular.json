Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. One wine you could try is Enate Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot. It has 4.8 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":2049876,"title":"Enate Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot","description":"Fully ruby color.
