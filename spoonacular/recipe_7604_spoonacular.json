Try pairing with Merlot, Pinot Noir, and rosé Wine. Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. One wine you could try is Director's Merlot. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 21 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428445,"title":"Director's Merlot","description":"Our 2014 Director's Merlot offers lushness and a round, full palate. Its fragrance demonstrates red and black fruit with hints of anise and spiced wood. Juicy upon entry, the wine broadens and becomes velvety on the palate with flavors of plum, loganberry and black cherry accentuated by subtle spice notes of espresso bean and toasted vanilla. Medium tannins support the body of this wine, offering sophistication in its finish. Pairs nicely with brisket, grilled pork chops and linguine with pesto.","price":"$21.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428445-312x231.jpg","averageRating":1.0,"ratingCount":1.0,"score":0.75,"link":"https://www.amazon.com/2014-Directors-Merlot-750-mL/dp/B073XVS4MB?tag=spoonacular-20"}]},"instructions":"Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, and saut 5 minutes or until tender. Stir in garlic, and cook 1 minute. Add wine, artichokes, and capers; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cover and cook about 3 minutes or just until tomatoes are wilted. Remove from heat, and stir in parsley. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add remaining 2 teaspoons oil. Sprinkle tuna with peppercorns and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Place tuna in skillet, and cook 2 to 4 minutes on each side or to desired degree of doneness. Serve with artichoke relish.

The Cavalchina is a fresh ros from northeastern Italy that offers a combination of fruit blossoms and light berries. The Alma de Blanco is made from the Godello grape, which is indigenous to northwestern Spain and complements its high acidity with ripe citrus flavors.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add onion, and saut 5 minutes or until tender.
