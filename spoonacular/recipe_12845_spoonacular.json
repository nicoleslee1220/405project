The best wine for Asian food depends on the cuisine and dish - of course - but these acidic whites pair with a number of traditional meals, spicy or not.

The Gewurztraminer (literally spicy or musky Traminer) is a selection of the most fragrant Traminers and became known as Gewurztraminer towards 1950. Light yellow with clear reflections. The wine has a youthful quality. The nose is expressive and reveals a floral dominant of rose, peony. Slightly candied, one perceives the exotic fruit, litchi and after aeration, one discovers notes of ginger and a hint of menthol. The nose displays a beautiful typicity, without extravagance but with preciseness. The onset in the mouth is ample and soft, vigorous; it evolves on a medium with a refreshing promptness. The same flavors of exotic fruits, ginger and floral of rose perceived in the nose are found, with a slight touch of bitterness on the finish. Pair with seasoned and flavorful cuisine such as Asian/fusion cuisine, Peruvian ceviches and foods with both spice and fruit elements.","price":"$23.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/479448-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.82,"ratingCount":9.0,"score":0.7842857142857143,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fdomaines-schlumberger-les-princes-abbes-gewurztraminer-2016%2F523506"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"originalId":null}
