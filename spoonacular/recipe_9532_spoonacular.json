Scrub beets, pat dry, rub with 1 tbsp. olive oil, and sprinkle generously with salt. Put beets on a foil-covered baking sheet and bake until tender when pierced, about 1 hour. Refrigerate uncovered until cool enough to handle, about 30 minutes. Cut off roots and stems, then rub beets with paper towels to remove skin; discard skin.                                                                                                 Cut beets in half lengthwise, then slice into half-moons about 1/4 in. thick; set aside. Cut ends off oranges, then cut away peel and outer membrane in wide strips, following the curve of the fruit with knife. Discard peel. Working over a bowl to catch juices, cut oranges between inner membranes and fruit to release segments into bowl; squeeze juice from membranes into bowl and discard membrane.
