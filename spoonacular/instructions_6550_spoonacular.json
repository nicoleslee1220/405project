Set in the fridge for at least an hour and up to overnight.3 Thread onto skewers:When skewering the fish and vegetables, pierce the fish against the grain, and select pieces of veggies that are close to the same size as your fish. This is important, because if the pieces are different widths, some things will be charred and others undercooked.You also want to be careful when loading up the skewers; it's easy to stab yourself by accident! Alternate pieces of fish with pieces of various veggies, leaving a little space between everything. Dont crowd the skewer, or the parts that are touching will cook too slowly.Note that by threading the skewers with assorted veggies and fish, some things will be cooked more or less than others, as some things take longer to cook than others. If you want all of your items to be cooked perfectly, use a separate skewer for the onions, one for the tuna, one for the bell peppers, etc.","ingredients":[{"id":11583,"name":"mixed vegetables","localizedName":"mixed vegetables","image":"mixed-vegetables.png"},{"id":10211821,"name":"bell pepper","localizedName":"bell pepper","image":"bell-pepper-orange.png"},{"id":11583,"name":"vegetable","localizedName":"vegetable","image":"mixed-vegetables.png"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"marinade","localizedName":"marinade","image":"seasoning.png"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","localizedName":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"},{"id":0,"name":"grains","localizedName":"grains","image":""},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"},{"id":10015121,"name":"tuna","localizedName":"tuna","image":"canned-tuna.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":3065,"name":"skewers","localizedName":"skewers","image":"wooden-skewers.jpg"}],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Put the onions and bell peppers down first because they take longer to cook.4 Grill on high, direct heat:Prepare the grill for high, direct heat.
