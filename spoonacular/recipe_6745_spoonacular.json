Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Chehalem 3 Vineyard Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 26 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":435394,"title":"Chehalem 3 Vineyard Pinot Gris","description":"A blend of three great vineyards, this vivid grape crafts a food-friendly wine, bright and pure.
