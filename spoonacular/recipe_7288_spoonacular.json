Buttery chardonnay is great for scallops, shrimp, crab, and lobster, while muscadet is a classic pick for mussels, oysters, and clams. If you've got some spice in your shellfish, a semi-dry riesling can balance out the heat. The Chateau Ste. Michelle Indian Wells Chardonnay Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.
