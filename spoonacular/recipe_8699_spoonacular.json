Let stand until yeast dissolves, about 15 minutes (mixture will not be foamy). Add both flours, 1/2 cup cool water, and 1 teaspoon coarse salt; mix on medium-low speed 4 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes, then mix on medium speed until dough is smooth, elastic, and slightly sticky, about 3 minutes.  Lightly oil medium bowl. Gather dough into ball and transfer to prepared bowl; turn to coat with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature 30 minutes. Chill dough overnight. DO AHEAD Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.  Transfer bowl to warm draft-free area and let dough rise, covered, until very slightly puffy, at least 2 hours.  Place pizza stone or rimless baking sheet in oven; preheat to 500F. Sprinkle pizza paddle or another baking sheet generously with cornmeal. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 12-inch round; transfer to paddle. Brush dough with oil; scatter peppers, then olives over. Sprinkle with Parmesan and rosemary. Arrange onion rings atop pizza, spacing apart. Slide pizza onto stone or baking sheet in oven; bake until lightly browned but not crisp, about 7 minutes. Remove pizza from oven and gently crack 1 egg into each onion ring. Return pizza to oven and continue to bake until eggs are softly set and crust is golden, about 6 minutes. Sprinkle pizza with salt and pepper. Scatter arugula over.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pour 2 tablespoons warm water into large bowl of stand mixer fitted with dough hook; sprinkle yeast over.","ingredients":[{"id":0,"name":"dough","localizedName":"dough","image":"pizza-dough"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","localizedName":"yeast","image":"yeast-granules.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404665,"name":"stand mixer","localizedName":"stand mixer","image":"stand-mixer.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Let stand until yeast dissolves, about 15 minutes (mixture will not be foamy).","ingredients":[{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","localizedName":"yeast","image":"yeast-granules.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":15,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add both flours, 1/2 cup cool water, and 1 teaspoon coarse salt; mix on medium-low speed 4 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":1002047,"name":"coarse salt","localizedName":"coarse salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":4,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Let rest 5 minutes, then mix on medium speed until dough is smooth, elastic, and slightly sticky, about 3 minutes.
