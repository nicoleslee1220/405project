Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine.

The palate is layered and lush, expressing undulating waves of red fruit woven together by a rich mid-palate and vibrant acidity. 7% Cabernet Sauvignon from the volcanic Rim Rock block and the rocky Quartz Hill block were blended in to add depth and structure to the wine. While we often describe this Merlot as a \"Cab lover's Merlot,\" the 2011 demonstrates what makes Merlot so lovely and special as a varietal wine – concentration, smooth but full texture, finesse and that elusive X factor that has \"lusciousness.\"Blend: 93% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Sauvignon.","price":"$49.97","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/445499-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":6.0,"score":0.8273684210526318,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fpride-mountain-vineyards-merlot-2011%2F153108"}]},"instructions":"To prepare aioli, combine first 9 ingredients in a blender; process until smooth.
