Split into two separate bowls and set aside.In a skillet over medium heat, heat olive oil and wilt arugula (this'll only take about 30-45 seconds.) Remove from skillet and chop. Allow to cool, then stir into one batch of the ricotta mixture. Set aside.In a small dish, beat together 1 egg and 3 tablespoons water. Set aside. Set a pot of water on to boil, then make the ravioli:Lay one wonton wrapper on the surface. Set a small amount (1/2 to 1 teaspoon) filling in the center of the wrapper. With a pastry brush, brush a 1/2-inch strip along all four sides of the wrapper. Place a second wrapper on top, working from the middle first. Carefully press out air bubbles as you carefully press the top wrapper around the base of the filling, then work your way out to the edges, lining the corners up and pressing lightly to seal. Set aside and repeat with remaining filling and wonton wrappers. (Make both all-cheese and arugula versions.)To make an egg yolk version, separate an egg by cracking it and cupping it in your fingers, allowing the white to escape between your fingers. Once you have only the yolk in your hand, carefully set it in the center of a wonton wrapper and repeat the sealing process above. You'll have to be gingerly, but once you get the hang of it, it'll be just fine!Once the ravioli are assembled, drop them four at a time into boiling water. Cook for 3 minutes, then remove with a slotted spoon.
