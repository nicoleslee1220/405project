To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Aubert Lauren Vineyard Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 139 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":441715,"title":"Aubert Lauren Vineyard Chardonnay","description":"The 2011 Lauren Estate Chardonnay always reminds one of a hypothetical vintage blend of Sonoma Coast meets White Burgundy. This 2011 Lauren is naturally clear with green chlorophyll tints on edge. Aromatics are classic Lauren with nuances of lemon-mineral, dried pear and even some green tea-like tones. The pronounced aromatics of fruits and minerals give an organic sense of place. The bouquet is multi-faceted with hints of apple-baked goods and wet stones. The mouth feel presents a glycerin top note, followed by an acid structure only found at Lauren.The wine has a slight hazy clarity showing Aubert's commitment to minimal interventional winemaking.","price":"$139.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/441715-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8175000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Faubert-lauren-vineyard-chardonnay-2011%2F122070"}]},"instructions":"Stir cucumber, mayonnaise, horseradish, parsley, and chives in medium bowl to blend. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD Sauce can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.Line large rimmed baking sheet with plastic wrap. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add carrots and leeks. Saut until soft but not brown, about 15 minutes. Cool in skillet.Beat eggs, matzo meal, coarse salt, and white pepper in large bowl to blend. Stir in carrot mixture. Place whitefish and salmon cubes in processor. Using on/off turns, chop fish to coarse paste (small pieces of fish will remain). Stir fish into matzo meal mixture.Using wet hands and about 1/3 cup for each, shape fish mixture into sixteen 1/2-inch-thick cakes. Arrange on prepared baking sheet. DO AHEAD Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover with plastic and chill.Add enough oil to 2 heavy large skillets to coat bottom. Heat oil over medium-high heat. Add 8 fish cakes to each skillet. Saut until golden and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. DO AHEAD Can be made 2 hours ahead. Transfer to another baking sheet, cover, and refrigerate. Rewarm uncovered in 350F oven 10 minutes.Arrange 2 fish cakes on each plate. Spoon sauce over or alongside. Garnish with lemon wedges and parsley.A Chardonnay would be delicious with the haroseth and the salmon and whitefish cakes. We like the apple, pear, and vanilla notes of the Baron Herzog 2006 Chardonnay from Herzog Wine Cellars on California's Central Coast. It's a great kosher wine and a good value at $13.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Stir cucumber, mayonnaise, horseradish, parsley, and chives in medium bowl to blend.
