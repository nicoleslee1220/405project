When the peppers are done, use tongs to put them in a ziptop bag which (for safety reasons) you have resting on a plate - (Remember, they're volcanically hot!). Carefully zip the bag shut, and allow them to sweat for 5 minutes. Use oven mitts to prevent getting burned while you handle the bag in the next step of sliding the peppers from the bag into a bowl filled with a couple of inches of ice water. You can then use your fingers to work quickly to slip off and discard the skins of the peppers while they are in the water. You will be left with beautifully cooked red peppers with a wonderful color.","ingredients":[{"id":11821,"name":"red pepper","localizedName":"red pepper","image":"red-pepper.jpg"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":10111333,"name":"peppers","localizedName":"peppers","image":"green-pepper.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404629,"name":"roasting pan","localizedName":"roasting pan","image":"roasting-pan.jpg"},{"id":404735,"name":"oven mitt","localizedName":"oven mitt","image":"oven-mitt.jpg"},{"id":404641,"name":"tongs","localizedName":"tongs","image":"tongs.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}],"length":{"number":20,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Remove stem and seeds.
