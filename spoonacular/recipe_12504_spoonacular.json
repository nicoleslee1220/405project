Halve 1 of the onions. Add the carrots, the onion halves, celery, garlic cloves, bay leaves, and peppercorns and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Decrease the heat to medium and simmer gently for 2 hours, skimming off any scum that rises to the top. Remove the chicken from the broth and let rest in a large dish until it is cool enough to handle. Strain the chicken broth and return it to the stockpot. You’ll have 10 to 12 cups of broth. Remove the skin from the cooled chicken and discard; shred the meat and return it to the broth in the stockpot.                                                                Heat the oil in a large skillet set over medium heat. Cut the remaining onion into 1/4-inch dice. Sauté the diced onion, minced garlic, poblano, and corn for about 3 minutes until the vegetables are soft. Stir the sautéed vegetables into the chicken stock, stir in the salt, oregano, and lime juice and bring the mixture to a simmer. Taste and add more salt and lime juice if needed. Serve hot with the toppings of your choice.                                                            do it early                The soup can be made up to 2 days in advance, covered, and refrigerated.
