Continue to cook butter remaining in skillet until it has a nutty fragrance and is golden brown, about 2 minutes. Blend brown butter with remaining crpeingredients, except chives, in a blender until smooth. Add chives and pulse 1 or 2 times to just combine. Let batter stand 30 minutes.                                                                            Blend brown butter with remaining crpe ingredients, except chives, in a blender until smooth. Add chives and pulse 1 or 2 times to just combine. Let batter stand 30 minutes.                                    Blanch whole chives:                                        Blanch chives in a small saucepan of boiling water 10 seconds. Drain and plunge into an ice bath. Pat dry.                                    Make crpes:                                        Lightly brush skillet with butter, then heat over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Stir batter. With skillet off heat, add a scant 1/4 cup batter, tilting and rotating skillet to coat bottom. (If batter sets too fast, reduce heat slightly.) Cook until golden around edges, 15 to 30 seconds. Loosen with a heatproof plastic spatula, then flip crpe over with your fingertips. Cook until underside is set, about 30 seconds. Slide onto a plate. Make more crpes, brushing skillet with butter and stacking crpes on plate.                                    Assemble purses:                                        Top each crpe, browned side up, with about 1 1/2 tablespoons sour cream and 2 teaspoon caviar. Gather crpe around filling and tie 1 or 2 blanched chives in a knot to close purse. Trim ends of chives if necessary.                                    Cooks' note:Crpe can be made and chives blanched 1 day ahead and chilled.
