Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Skyfall Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":445128,"title":"Skyfall Pinot Gris","description":"Pale straw in color with notes of mango, citrus blossom and banana in the nose.
