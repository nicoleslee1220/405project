Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like ahi tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your ahi tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. One wine you could try is Provenance Vineyards Napa Valley Merlot. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 34 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":432837,"title":"Provenance Vineyards Napa Valley Merlot","description":"Our 2006 Merlot isn't shy, with its deep, dark garnet hue and abounding aromas of rich black\ncherry, cassis and clove.
