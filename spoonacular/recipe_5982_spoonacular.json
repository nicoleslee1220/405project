Or mix the ingredients by hand, smoothing lumps with your fingers and beating with a fork to thicken slightly.    With your hands, toss the chicken or fish with the marinade to evenly coat and separate the pieces. Cover with plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes or overnight.    In a wok or stir-fry pan, bring the water to a steaming, near simmer, or bring the oil to the slow-fry stage, 275F on a deep-fry thermometer. Next to the stove, set a plate big enough to hold the fish or chicken in a single layer. Have a large Chinese mesh skimmer at hand.    Toss the chicken or fish once more and slide it into the hot water or oil, leaving any excess marinade behind. Stir gently with chopsticks to separate the pieces. Watch carefully to see when the outside turns 95% white, 5 to 10 seconds for shreds or tiny cubes, 30 to 45 seconds for larger nuggets.
