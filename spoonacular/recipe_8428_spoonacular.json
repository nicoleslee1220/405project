(Be sure the grate is hot, too.) Wipe the mushrooms clean and trim off the stems. If using portabellas, scrape out the black gills with the side of a spoon. Put the clean whole mushrooms in a large bowl, drizzle with 5 tablespoons of the oil, and gently toss. Sprinkle in a pinch of kosher salt and toss again. Grill the mushrooms directly over the heat until tender and well marked, 3 to 5 minutes on each side. If using portabellas, quickly cut the grilled mushrooms into 1-inch slices.      Portion the arugula among four plates and top with the hot mushrooms. Garnish with the nuts and cheese and a generous drizzle of olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with fleur de sel or other sea salt and a grind of white or black pepper.
