Season with salt and pepper and extra vinegar, if desired (we felt it needed it). Divide among plates and pass with remaining goat cheese to sprinkle.* I swapped half with sweet (not hot) smoked paprika to make sure it didnt get too spicy for a 13 month-olds tastes. If you dont have either on hand, there are ways to approximate this smoky/spiciness with what you have in your pantry, such as mixing some regular paprika with a ground chipotle powder or another smoky spice, and then a pinch of cayenne for extra heat.See more: Beans, Fall, Photo, Salad, Thanksgiving, Vegetarian, Winter Squash","ingredients":[{"id":1052009,"name":"ground chipotle chile pepper","localizedName":"ground chipotle chile pepper","image":"chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","localizedName":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":1012028,"name":"smoked paprika","localizedName":"smoked paprika","image":"paprika.jpg"},{"id":10111485,"name":"winter squash","localizedName":"winter squash","image":"butternut-squash.jpg"},{"id":1159,"name":"goat cheese","localizedName":"goat cheese","image":"goat-cheese.jpg"},{"id":11959,"name":"arugula","localizedName":"arugula","image":"arugula-or-rocket-salad.jpg"},{"id":2031,"name":"ground cayenne pepper","localizedName":"ground cayenne pepper","image":"chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":10316069,"name":"lentils","localizedName":"lentils","image":"lentils-brown.jpg"},{"id":2028,"name":"paprika","localizedName":"paprika","image":"paprika.jpg"},{"id":11422,"name":"pumpkin","localizedName":"pumpkin","image":"pumpkin.png"},{"id":2053,"name":"vinegar","localizedName":"vinegar","image":"vinegar-(white).jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"beans","localizedName":"beans","image":"kidney-beans.jpg"},{"id":2064,"name":"mint","localizedName":"mint","image":"mint.jpg"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","localizedName":"baking sheet","image":"baking-sheet.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Do more: Link | Bookmark| Pin | Print| Email| 312 Comments","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]}]}]
