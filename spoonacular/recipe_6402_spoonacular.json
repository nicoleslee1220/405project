Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Zind-Humbrecht Clos Windsbuhl Vendange Tardive Pinot Gris with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 99 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":494626,"title":"Zind-Humbrecht Clos Windsbuhl Vendange Tardive Pinot Gris","description":"","price":"$99.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/494626-312x231.jpg","averageRating":1.0,"ratingCount":6.0,"score":0.9473684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fzind-humbrecht-clos-windsbuhl-vendange-tardive-pinot-gris-2005%2F322199"}]},"instructions":"Light a grill.
