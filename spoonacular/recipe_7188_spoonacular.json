Combine juice and oil; brush inside of fish. Combine thyme, salt, paprika, and pepper; sprinkle evenly inside cavity of each fish. Place 3 lemon slices into cavity of each fish.

This wine's modest amount of oak tones helps it remain bright and fruity. Its fresh mineral qualities complement the delicate flavors of the fish, while the zippy acidity resonates with the lemon and smoky paprika.
