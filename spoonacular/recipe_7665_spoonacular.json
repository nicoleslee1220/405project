To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Lapis Luna Chardonnay with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":485260,"title":"Lapis Luna Chardonnay","description":"Orange zest, ripe pineapple, toast, and vanilla on the nose.
