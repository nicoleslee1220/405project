Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try St. Michael-Eppan Anger Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 23 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":490914,"title":"St. Michael-Eppan Anger Pinot Grigio","description":"Depending on the soil and microclimate, Pinot gris varies from a simple everyday wine all the way up to absolute top growths. The warm, sun-exposed vineyards of the Anger sites, with their loamy limestone gravel soils, are a textbook example. The Anger Alto Adige Pinot Grigio has a noble structure, nice balance and fine acidity – making it an absolute pleasure to drink. The strong white goes well with fish and fish soup, guinea fowl breast or veal fillet.","price":"$22.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/490914-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":22.0,"score":0.8450746268656716,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fst-michael-eppan-anger-pinot-grigio-2018%2F535614"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.In a shallow dish, combine the cheese with the paprika and parsley and season with salt and pepper.Drizzle the fish with olive oil and dredge in the cheese mixture.Place on a foil lined baking sheet and bake until the fish is opaque in the thickest part, 10 to 12 minutes.Serve the fish with the lemon wedges.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.In a shallow dish, combine the cheese with the paprika and parsley and season with salt and pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","localizedName":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":2028,"name":"paprika","localizedName":"paprika","image":"paprika.jpg"},{"id":11297,"name":"parsley","localizedName":"parsley","image":"parsley.jpg"},{"id":1041009,"name":"cheese","localizedName":"cheese","image":"cheddar-cheese.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Drizzle the fish with olive oil and dredge in the cheese mixture.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":1041009,"name":"cheese","localizedName":"cheese","image":"cheddar-cheese.png"},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Place on a foil lined baking sheet and bake until the fish is opaque in the thickest part, 10 to 12 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","localizedName":"baking sheet","image":"baking-sheet.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"},{"id":404765,"name":"aluminum foil","localizedName":"aluminum foil","image":"aluminum-foil.png"}],"length":{"number":10,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Serve the fish with the lemon wedges.","ingredients":[{"id":1029150,"name":"lemon wedge","localizedName":"lemon wedge","image":"lemon-wedge.png"},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]}],"originalId":null}
