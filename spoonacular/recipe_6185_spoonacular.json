Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Menage a Trois Limelight Pinot Grigio.

To make 1/2 cup: grate 1 pound of daikon together with 16 dried chilies that have been soaked in hot water for 5 minutes.Lightly season the fish with salt all over, including the cavities. Let the fish rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.Wipe off moisture that accumulates on the surface of the fish with paper towels.Cut a 1/2-inch-deep slit lengthwise along the centerline of each fish, from head to tail. Do this on both sides; the cuts will help the fish cook faster and make it easier to flake off the grilled flesh.To make the dipping sauce, divide the momiji oroshi and scallions between the 4 bowls of ponzu; set aside.Preheat a grill to medium-hot. Brush the cooking grate clean and oil it well.Grill the fish about 5 minutes per side. Flip the snappers with caregently turn them with a fish spatula so they dont break apart. When the fish are ready, youll see juice bubbling from the back, and if you peek inside the cavity, youll see that the spine and flesh near it will have turned white.Serve the fish immediately, accompanied by the ponzu dipping sauce. Ponzu,Makes about 1 1/2 cupsAdd the sake and mirin to a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 1 minute, remove from heat, and let the liquid come to room temperature.In a bowl, stir together the soy sauce, citrus juice, vinegar, the 1/4 cup water, the sake mixture, kombu, and bonito flakes.
