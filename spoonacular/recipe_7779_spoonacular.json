Combine the peppercorns, coriander seeds and cumin seeds in a spice grinder and grind until quite fine. Add the ground almonds and grind again briefly. Add the turmeric to the spice mixture and set aside.                                  Using a potato masher or the back of a wooden spoon, crush the (now soft) tamarind pods to release the pulp, stirring to combine with the water, which will turn cloudy and sort of pinkish-brown. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh sieve into a small bowl and discard the pods. Set aside.                                  Heat the oil in a large, wide saut pan over medium heat, add the onion, garlic, ginger and a large pinch of salt and cook gently for about 5 minutes, until starting to soften. Stir in the spices and cook for another couple of minutes, until quite fragrant.                                  Add the coconut milk, chiles, 2/3 cup of the tamarind water, and the lime juice and simmer for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Salt the tuna pieces lightly and add them to the pan, reducing the heat to low. Simmer until the tuna is just cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes, turning the pieces once halfway through so they cook evenly. Taste and add more salt if needed, and garnish with the cilantro. Serve with rice.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium bowl, pour 3/4 cup boiling water over the tamarind pods and set aside to soak.","ingredients":[{"id":1019322,"name":"tamarind","localizedName":"tamarind","image":"tamarind.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Combine the peppercorns, coriander seeds and cumin seeds in a spice grinder and grind until quite fine.","ingredients":[{"id":2013,"name":"whole coriander seeds","localizedName":"whole coriander seeds","image":"coriander-seeds.jpg"},{"id":2014,"name":"cumin seeds","localizedName":"cumin seeds","image":"ground-cumin.jpg"},{"id":1022030,"name":"peppercorns","localizedName":"peppercorns","image":"black-pepper.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the ground almonds and grind again briefly.","ingredients":[{"id":93740,"name":"almond meal","localizedName":"almond meal","image":"almond-meal-or-almond-flour.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the turmeric to the spice mixture and set aside.","ingredients":[{"id":2043,"name":"turmeric","localizedName":"turmeric","image":"turmeric.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Using a potato masher or the back of a wooden spoon, crush the (now soft) tamarind pods to release the pulp, stirring to combine with the water, which will turn cloudy and sort of pinkish-brown.
