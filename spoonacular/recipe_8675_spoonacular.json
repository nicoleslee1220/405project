Cut bell peppers in half lengthwise; discard seeds and membranes. Place pepper halves, skin sides up, on a foil-lined baking sheet; flatten with hand. Broil 15 minutes or until blackened.

Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 1/4 teaspoon garlic; cook 30 seconds. Add bell peppers and tomatoes to pan; cook 4 minutes or until tomatoes are tender, stirring occasionally.

Combine remaining 3/4 teaspoon garlic, vinegar, and next 5 ingredients (through black pepper) in a small bowl; stir with a whisk.

Wine note: Fresh summer vegetables come together in Orecchiette with Roasted Peppers, Arugula, and Tomatoes, making it a good candidate for a dry ros wine. With berry and Bing cherry flavors and bright acidity, Bonterra Ros 2008 ($14), from California, is a great example of how ros complements the acid and fruitiness of tomatoes. This wine also has a slightly herbal edge, reminiscent of the dish's herbes de Provence. --Jeffery Lindenmuth","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat broiler.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":405914,"name":"broiler","localizedName":"broiler","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Cut bell peppers in half lengthwise; discard seeds and membranes.","ingredients":[{"id":10211821,"name":"bell pepper","localizedName":"bell pepper","image":"bell-pepper-orange.png"},{"id":93818,"name":"seeds","localizedName":"seeds","image":"sunflower-seeds.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Place pepper halves, skin sides up, on a foil-lined baking sheet; flatten with hand.
