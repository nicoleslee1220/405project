Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir.

We should all eat more fish.Not only more fish, but fish that's sustainable, low in mercury, in this economy, affordable, and oh yeah, tasty, too.Whew!Is anyone else overwhelmed by all the requirements? Making good dietary choices can be like navigating through a minefield without losing a limb (did you see the ads and read about the new Taco Bell Drive-Thru Diet?!). One of the most readily available fish in the supermarket is farm-raised Tilapia. It's tasty, easy to cook up and inexpensive. But does it meet the above guidelines?I've done the research, and while there are some asterisks that I'll discuss, the answer is yes.  Seafood Watch rates farm-raised tilapia a \"best\" choicewhen it's raised in the United States. It's high in protein and an excellent source of phosphorus, niacin, selenium, vitamin B12, and a good source of potassium. It's also exceptionally budget-friendly, which is important. However, unlike the touted salmon, farm-raised tilapia is not a great source of omega-3 fatty acids. But this isn't the poor little tilapia's fault - rather it's caused by the corn-based food most farm-raised fish are fed (this is the same reason why our meat supply is so unhealthy). You are what you eat, and this holds true for fish as much as people. Wild fish eat a diet rich in algae, which is the reason they contain so many omega-3's, which then trickle up the food chain to us (by the way, the same holds true for grass-fed meat). So this could be corrected by reforming our farming practices to feed the fish a diet rich in omega-3's. It's that simple. But when you consider all the choices out there and shake it out, I believe that tilapia can be part of a healthy, varied diet. Just make sure you scoop up a handful of walnuts to get your daily dose of omega-3's from another source.Here's a fast recipe that I whip up from time to time. While I made it with tilapia, it would be great with catfish or snapper, too. I serve the blackened fish over a quick soft polenta. Just pair this meal with a veggie and you're all set (I recommend my Roasted Broccoli with Garlic and Parmesan Reggiano). Also, don't forget to click click click away on my blog Domestic Divas!
