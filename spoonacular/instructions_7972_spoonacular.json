Im not entirely sure how, why and where it all started, but I literally became addicted to measuring spoons ever since I started volume cooking. Always looking out for new spoons. Homage to my measuring spoons!Sorry bout that. Had to get it out of my system!Back to the bowls.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404719,"name":"measuring spoon","localizedName":"measuring spoon","image":"measuring-spoons.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Pour in 1 tbsp olive oil and top that with 2 tbsp mayonnaise (Im actually using a diet version here). Also add a tsp coarse mustard, a good pinch of salt and pepper and whisk until you have a smooth, creamy dressing.Slice a small piece of red onion. Depending on how much you like it, you can up or tone down the quantity. I went for roughly 1/4 of a small onion.Finely chop a spring onion. Or are they called scallions?Grab a small handful of olives (8 to 10). Ive used the ones stuffed with pimento but that was mainly for color, it doesnt have that much flavor, I think. Finely slice them.Rocket science! Open up a can of tuna, drain it and put it in a bowl. Now dont mash everything up, keep a little texture in there.Now add all your chopped ingredients and put in a really good pinch of dried basil as well. Ive used close to 1/2 tsp. I was surprised to find how well basil works with tuna.Spoon your dressing on top and carefully fold everything together. Please, please dont turn it into a liquid substance, its just so unappealing. I know fish has to swim, but does it have to be in dressing? Show it some respect, just grab a glass of white wine! :)Squeeze in a little fresh lemon juice.I prefer eating tuna salad on warm ciabatta. As soon as it comes out of the oven I slice it, grab a garlic clove, cut it in half and rub both sides of the ciabatta with the clove. This will givethe bread alight garlic flavor. Just enough to make a difference but not enough to be an overtone.My tuna sandwich always has cucumber in it, the combination is really great. Im sure you can do this with lettuce as well, but Ive eaten so many tuna salads on cucumber slices as a low carber that those two are now simply inextricably connected to each other. Just place some thin slices on your bread and spoon the tuna salad on top. I like to finish it with afew thin cucumber match sticks on top.Nowthis isa very, veryrich ciabattawith quite a bit of filling. You might want to consider sharing it with someone:)Printable","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","localizedName":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":10211215,"name":"whole garlic cloves","localizedName":"whole garlic cloves","image":"garlic.jpg"},{"id":11291,"name":"spring onions","localizedName":"spring onions","image":"spring-onions.jpg"},{"id":2003,"name":"dried basil","localizedName":"dried basil","image":"basil.jpg"},{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","localizedName":"lemon juice","image":"lemon-juice.jpg"},{"id":4025,"name":"mayonnaise","localizedName":"mayonnaise","image":"mayonnaise.png"},{"id":14106,"name":"white wine","localizedName":"white wine","image":"white-wine.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":10011282,"name":"red onion","localizedName":"red onion","image":"red-onion.png"},{"id":11291,"name":"green onions","localizedName":"green onions","image":"spring-onions.jpg"},{"id":93655,"name":"ciabatta","localizedName":"ciabatta","image":"ciabatta-loaf.jpg"},{"id":11206,"name":"cucumber","localizedName":"cucumber","image":"cucumber.jpg"},{"id":11252,"name":"lettuce","localizedName":"lettuce","image":"iceberg-lettuce.jpg"},{"id":2046,"name":"mustard","localizedName":"mustard","image":"regular-mustard.jpg"},{"id":11943,"name":"pimiento","localizedName":"pimiento","image":"pimento.png"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","localizedName":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":9195,"name":"olives","localizedName":"olives","image":"olives-mixed.jpg"},{"id":11959,"name":"arugula","localizedName":"arugula","image":"arugula-or-rocket-salad.jpg"},{"id":2044,"name":"basil","localizedName":"basil","image":"basil.jpg"},{"id":18064,"name":"bread","localizedName":"bread","image":"white-bread.jpg"},{"id":1002011,"name":"clove","localizedName":"clove","image":"cloves.jpg"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","localizedName":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"},{"id":10015121,"name":"tuna","localizedName":"tuna","image":"canned-tuna.png"},{"id":1012034,"name":"dry seasoning rub","localizedName":"dry seasoning rub","image":"seasoning.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","localizedName":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Recipe kayotic.com","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]}]}]
