Heat the olive oil in an ovenproof pot over medium heat. Add the onion and thyme and cook until the onion is slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in the rice and cook, stirring, until glossy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the wine and cook, stirring, until it's absorbed, about 1 minute. Add 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste.                          Pour the broth and 1 1/2 cups water over the rice and bring to a simmer, about 4 minutes. Stir, then cover and transfer to the oven. Bake 20 minutes, stirring halfway through.                          Meanwhile, cook the peas in 4 cups salted boiling water until tender, about 5 minutes.
