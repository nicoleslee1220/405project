Try pairing with Merlot, Pinot Noir, and rosé Wine. Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. One wine you could try is Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Merlot. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 20 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":2043776,"title":"Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Merlot","description":"83% Merlot, 7% Malbec, 5% Cabernet Franc, 5% Syrah.\n\nThis 2007 Merlot exhibits bold aromas of wild blueberries, red raspberries punctuated with hints of cassis and Ceylon black\ntea.
