To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Canyon Road Chardonnay with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Meanwhile, in a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over high heat, bring about 1 inch water to a boil. Rinse asparagus and snap off tough stem ends. Add asparagus or broccoli to pan and boil, uncovered, until bright green and barely tender when pierced, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain; rinse with cold water until cold.                                                                                                 Rinse salmon and pat dry. Coat flesh sides equally with all the spice rub. Lay fish, coated side down, on a grill over hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook fish, turning once, until opaque but still moist-looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), 7 to 9 minutes total. Transfer to a plate.                                                                                                 Rinse Belgian endive; trim off and discard discolored ends. Set aside 12 leaves; cut remaining leaves crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide slices and place in a bowl. Add salad greens, tomatoes, onion, and 1/4 cup raspberry vinaigrette; mix gently.                                                                                                 Arrange asparagus and whole endive leaves equally around edges of plates. Mound salad mixture equally in center of plates; top with warm salmon. Sprinkle servings equally with walnuts, raspberries, and soybeans. Drizzle remaining vinaigrette over the top. Serve with pumpernickel rolls.                                                                                                Spice rub: In a blender, whirl 1 tablespoon each coriander seeds and fennel seeds and 1 1/2 teaspoons each dried thyme and black peppercorns until finely ground.
