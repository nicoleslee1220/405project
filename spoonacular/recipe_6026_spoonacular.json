Add the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, and chile flakes and cook, shaking the pan constantly, until the spices are very fragrant, 30 to 60 seconds. Grind to a fine powder in a spice grinder.    In a medium bowl, combine the coconut milk, garlic, ginger, shrimp, and spice powder and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 10 and up to 30 minutes.    In a 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and the marinade and cook, stirring and shaking the pan, until the shrimp are pink and cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes, adding 1 Tbs. water at a time if necessary to keep the marinade from scorching. Remove from the heat and add the cilantro and lime juice. Season with salt and pepper and serve garnished with the lime wedges.
