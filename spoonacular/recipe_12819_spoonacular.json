Heat a large saucepan over low heat; add butter and sugar. Simmer a couple of minutes, stirring occasionally, until sugar has completely dissolved and the mixture darkens. Gently stir in pecans until well-coated; be careful not to splash yourself. Transfer nuts to cookie sheet; use the back of a spoon to separate them into one layer. Allow to cool so caramel hardens.                                                                                                 Combine orange zest, orange juice, mustard, vinegar, and oil in a large salad bowl; stir well with a whisk. Have a taste--you want a nice balance between the vinegar and the oil. Adjust, if needed, and season with salt and pepper.                                                                                                 Add apples and greens to dressing.
