Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. You could try Raymond R Collection Merlot. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":439335,"title":"Raymond R Collection Merlot","description":"The Merlot fills the mouth with smooth cherry, raspberry and plum flavors along with hints of earth and spice in the toasty vanilla finish.
