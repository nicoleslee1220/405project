Using a pasty blender, cut cold butter into flour until your mixture looks like a course meal with some pea sized pieces of butter. Mix the water into the yogurt and add to the flour mixture. Mix till you get a nice dough.Form the dough into a ball. On a floury surface, roll into an 18 by 9 inch rectangle. Take the ends and fold the dough crosswise into thirds forming a 6 by 9 inch rectangle. Fold the dough into thirds again from the other side (to your right, so that you have a small square or even ball like shape). Wrap dough and chill in the fridge for 1 hour.While the dough is chilling make the filling. Heat the olive oil in a medium-sized sautÃ© pan set over medium heat. Add the cabbage, carrot, onion, garlic, remaining ¼ t salt, and mustard seeds to the pan. SautÃ© for 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the broth and continue to cook and stir until the pan is nearly dry. Remove from heat and cool.At this point cut the chilled dough in half. Roll each half of the dough out on a floured surface into a 12 inch square. Cut the two 12 inch squares into 8 equally-sized squares. Divide the cooled cabbage mixture equally among the 8 squares. Fold over the edges of the dough toward each other to form a triangular shape. Crimp the edges together with the end of a fork and brush with egg and sprinkle with additional salt.Bake at 395 for 10 minutes. Turn the heat down to 385 and bake for 12-15 more minutes or until golden.
