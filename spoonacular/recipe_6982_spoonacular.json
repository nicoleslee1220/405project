Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Alsace Willm Pinot Gris Reserve with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 16 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":496346,"title":"Alsace Willm Pinot Gris Reserve","description":"An intense golden color with hints of ocher, the wine has a nose of ripe fruit, quince.

Then, dip each piece of fish in the flour and shake off any excess. Transfer to the egg mixture, coating all sides, and allowing any extra to drip off. Finally, place the piece of fish in the panko bread crumbs and coat evenly, gently pressing the bread crumbs into the egg coating. Place the piece of fish on the baking sheet and repeat until all of the fish has been breaded. To avoid messy, clumpy fingers when breading, use one hand for the dry ingredients and one hand for the wet ingredients (I always use my right hand for the dry ingredients, and my left hand for the wet ingredients). As long as you can keep your hands straight, which can be easier said than done, you can avoid breading your fingers along with the fish!Bake the fish for approximately 15 minutes, turning once. The outside of the fish will be golden and crisp, and the inside will be moist and flaky.While the fish is baking, prepare the slaw. In a large bowl, combine the cabbage, onion, carrot, and cilantro. In a separate small mixing bowl, whisk together the chipotle pepper in adobo, sour cream, honey, and lime juice. Once combined, pour over the cabbage mixture. Use a pair of tongs to toss the slaw, evenly coating the cabbage mixture with the dressing.To assemble the tacos, place two pieces of fish on each tortilla and top with the honey chipotle slaw. If desired, garnish with additional lime wedges and cilantro leaves (the lime wedges work well to prop up the edges of the tacos).
