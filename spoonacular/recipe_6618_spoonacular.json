Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Maysaran Arsheen Pinot Gris. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":476600,"title":"Maysara Arsheen Pinot Gris","description":"A bright expression of fruit right up front, greeting your palate with notes of cut grass on a warm day.

Place the orange and lemon juices in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until reduced to 1/3 cup, 10 to 12 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, whisk in 1 teaspoon of the honey, and taste the orange sauce; it should be nicely sweet and tart. If it is too tart, add more honey. Let the sauce cook for another minute. Season the sauce with salt to taste and keep warm until ready to serve.

Grill the swordfish on an oiled grate positioned 5 inches above the glowing coals, or broil it, until just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. The fish is done when it just flakes when prodded with a fork. Transfer the fish to a plate and cover it with aluminum foil to keep warm.                                                     Heat 1 teaspoons olive oil in a large skillet over high heat with the garlic. Add the asparagus and cook, tossing, for 1 minute. Add the fish stock and thyme and bring to a boil. Cover the skillet and cook the asparagus until it is bright green and crisp-tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the asparagus to a plate. Continue to cook the fish stock mixture until it is reduced and syrupy, 3 to 5 minutes. Divide the asparagus among 4 plates and drizzle the fish stock mixture on it. Arrange a fish steak on each plate and drizzle the orange sauce over the asparagus and the fish. Drizzle a little olive oil over each serving and sprinkle sea salt on top.
