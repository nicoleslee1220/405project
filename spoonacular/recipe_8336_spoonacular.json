To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. One wine you could try is Lapis Luna Chardonnay. It has 4.7 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 13 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":485260,"title":"Lapis Luna Chardonnay","description":"Orange zest, ripe pineapple, toast, and vanilla on the nose.
