Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. You could try Robert Mondavi Napa Merlot. Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 30 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438573,"title":"Robert Mondavi Napa Merlot","description":"The wine's multi-dimensional flavors come from grapes grown in distinctly different terroirs of Napa Valley, including the Carneros, Stags Leap and Oakville districts. Traditional techniques, including native yeasts, extended maceration, aging in French oak barrels and bottling without filtration, enhanced the wine's complexity. This wine is delicious with many entrees and cheeses. One of our favorite food pairings is roast turkey with a wild mushroom and walnut stuffing. Roast leg of lamb, rubbed with fragrant herbs and spices, or grilled pork loin also marry perfectly with the wine's luscious flavors.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438573-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":25.0,"score":0.7868421052631579,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Frobert-mondavi-napa-merlot-1999%2F51817"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"sourceName":null,"creditsText":null,"originalId":null}
