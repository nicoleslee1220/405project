Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Zind-Humbrecht Calcaire Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 46 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":467219,"title":"Zind-Humbrecht Calcaire Pinot Gris","description":"Bright yellow/gold color, quite luminous. Superb smoky toasty nose, typical for this grape on limestone in Alsace (no new oak in our wines, just very long total lees contact). Some light reductive aromas that actually fit the style of dry Pinot-Gris. The palate is rich and creamy, with a velvety texture yet fully dry. It is an easy wine to drink now as there is no unnecessary weight. The finish is nice and round but fully dry. The complex limestone blend brings great acid balance and a certain weight. It should develop very nicely over the next few years.","price":"$45.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/467219-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8775000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fzind-humbrecht-calcaire-pinot-gris-2015%2F208573"}]},"instructions":"Prepare a large bowl with ice water and set aside.                          Bring a medium pot of cold water to a boil then season with a tablespoon of salt. Add the beans and cook for approximately 3 to 4 minutes or until just crisp tender. Drain and immediately plunge into the ice water to stop the cooking. Let sit in the ice water for a few minutes, and then drain well.                          Place potatoes in a medium saucepan, cover with cold water and season with 1 tablespoon of salt and cook until almost cooked through (a knife or skewer inserted into the center goes in with a little resistance). Drain well and place on a baking sheet to cool slightly. Once cool enough to handle, slice potatoes lengthwise, brush with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place on the grill, cut side down and cook until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes, turn over and grill until just cooked through, about 1 to 2 minutes longer.                          Place cooked beans, grilled potatoes, tomatoes, and onions, in a large bowl. Add the vinaigrette and gently toss to combine; season with salt and pepper. Cover and let sit at room temperature while you prepare the swordfish.                          Add swordfish cubes to salad, toss to combine, and divide among 4 plates. Garnish each serving with 1 tablespoon torn parsley.                          Heat grill to high.                          Combine spices and salt and pepper in a bowl. Brush both sides of swordfish with oil and season with a little salt. Rub 1 side of each steak with 1/4 of the spice mixture. Place swordfish on the grill, spice side down and cook until slightly charred and a crust has formed, about 4 to 5 minutes. Flip the fish over and continue cooking for 2 to 3 minutes or until just cooked through. Remove from the grill and let rest 5 minutes. Dice swordfish into bite-size pieces.                          Whisk together vinegar, honey, garlic and anchovy paste and season with salt and pepper. Slowly whisk in the olive oil and set aside.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare a large bowl with ice water and set aside.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Bring a medium pot of cold water to a boil then season with a tablespoon of salt.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","localizedName":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the beans and cook for approximately 3 to 4 minutes or until just crisp tender.","ingredients":[{"id":0,"name":"beans","localizedName":"beans","image":"kidney-beans.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Drain and immediately plunge into the ice water to stop the cooking.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Let sit in the ice water for a few minutes, and then drain well.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":6,"step":"Place potatoes in a medium saucepan, cover with cold water and season with 1 tablespoon of salt and cook until almost cooked through (a knife or skewer inserted into the center goes in with a little resistance).","ingredients":[{"id":11352,"name":"potato","localizedName":"potato","image":"potatoes-yukon-gold.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","localizedName":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"},{"id":3065,"name":"skewers","localizedName":"skewers","image":"wooden-skewers.jpg"},{"id":404745,"name":"knife","localizedName":"knife","image":"chefs-knife.jpg"}]},{"number":7,"step":"Drain well and place on a baking sheet to cool slightly.
