(As you do so, the out leaves will fall off. Keep and use any that are not bruised!) Then slice a piece from one side, place the sprout cut side down (for slicing stability), and cut the sprout crosswise into about 5 slices (more or less, depending on its size). Repeat until you have cut up all the sprouts in this way.                                                     Place a large (10- to 12- inch) heavy skillet over medium heat. After about a minute, add the olive oil and swirl to coat the pan. Add the shallots, and saut for 2 minutes. Stir in the Brussels sprouts and salt, pour in 3 tablespoons of the water, and spread everything evenly across the bottom of the pan. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and let cook, undisturbed, for 5 minutes.                                                     Meanwhile, combine the mustard, brown sugar and remaining 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl, and stir until blended.                                                     Once the Brussels sprouts have cooked for 5 minutes, pour in the mustard mixture, stirring to distribute it well. Turn the heat to low, cover the pan, and cook, undisturbed, for 3 minutes.                                                     Stir again, and decide if you like the sprouts cooked to this degree or if you want to cook them a bit more. You can leave the skillet on the stove over low heat for up to 5 minutes longer, in which case the sprouts will brown and become more intensely flavoredits your call. Serve hot or warm, topped with a generous amount of black pepper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                var articleType_27_data = {};                    articleType_27_data.init_step_by_step_images = 0;","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Use a very sharp knife to cut off and discard the base of the Brussels sprouts.
