In a pie plate, toast the hazelnuts for about 10 minutes, or until they are fragrant and browned. Transfer the hot nuts to a kitchen towel and rub them together to remove the skins. Let the nuts cool completely, then coarsely chop them.                                              Meanwhile, bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil with the smashed garlic. Add the shrimp and cook until opaque, about 2 minutes. Drain and let cool; discard the garlic.                                              In a large bowl, whisk the lemon juice with the minced garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a generous pinch of pepper. Whisk in the hazelnut and olive oils, then stir in the basil, celery leaves, scallion and 2 tablespoons of the chopped hazelnuts.                                              Coarsely chop the shrimp and add to the dressing. Season with salt and pepper and toss to coat.                                              Arrange the endive leaves on a large platter and spoon the shrimp salad onto them.
