Cut into 1-inch cubes and lightly blot with more paper towels.                                                                                                 In a bowl, mix soy sauce, lime juice, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and cayenne. Add tofu and mix gently to coat cubes completely. Let stand 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.                                                                                                 Meanwhile, in another bowl, mix cabbage with vinegar.
