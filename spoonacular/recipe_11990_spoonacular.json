Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Santa Margherita Chianti Classico Riserva with a 4.8 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

An exquisite expression of the Sangiovese grape, with substantial acidity from the low pH of the soil in this region.The aromas of this complex red wine range from cherries and plums to gladiolus flowers and earthy flint. The tannic, oak-aged flavors are bright and round, with a dry, warm, earthy finish.Best enjoyed with very flavorful dishes, such as tomato-based sauces, mushroom ravioli, beef or pork roasts, and game meats from venison to pheasant. It is also excellent with mature cheeses.Blend: 85% Sangiovese, 15% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon","price":"$26.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/436659-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.96,"ratingCount":8.0,"score":0.9199999999999999,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fsanta-margherita-chianti-classico-riserva-2013%2F167314"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"originalId":null}
