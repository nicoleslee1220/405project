Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Rabble Pinot Gris with a 4.9 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":452031,"title":"Rabble Pinot Gris","description":"Alsatian-inspired with notes of lime, green apple, white flower and wetstone.
