Stand the fruit on one of its cut ends and slice off the skin in strips (try to get all the bitter white pith). Working over a bowl, cut the segments free from the membrane, letting each segment fall into the bowl as you go. When youve removed all the segments, squeeze the membrane to extract all the juice. Repeat with the second fruit. Spoon out the grapefruit segments from the bowl and set them aside on a plate. Remove any seeds from the juice.    Measure out 3 Tbs. juice into a small bowl. Save the rest for another use (or drink it). Whisk the lime juice, honey, and salt into the grapefruit juice. Whisk in the oil and then the chopped mint. Drag an arugula leaf though the vinaigrette and taste for seasoning. Drizzle about 1 Tbs. of the vinaigrette over the grapefruit segments.    Combine the arugula and radicchio in a large bowl. Toss with enough of the vinaigrette to evenly but lightly coat the leaves (you may not need all of it). Arrange the greens on six salad plates and garnish with the grapefruit segments, almonds, and a few mint leaves.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Size                        :                      based on six servings, Calories                        (kcal):                      150, Fat                        (kcal):                      12, Fat Calories                        (g):                      110, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      1.5, Protein                        (g):                      3, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      8, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      11, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      1.5, Sodium                        (g):                      45, Cholesterol                        (g):                      0, Fiber                        (g):                      2,                     Photo: Scott Phillips          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"With a sharp knife, cut away both ends of one of the grapefruit.
