Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Zind-Humbrecht Calcaire Pinot Gris with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 46 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":467219,"title":"Zind-Humbrecht Calcaire Pinot Gris","description":"Bright yellow/gold color, quite luminous. Superb smoky toasty nose, typical for this grape on limestone in Alsace (no new oak in our wines, just very long total lees contact). Some light reductive aromas that actually fit the style of dry Pinot-Gris. The palate is rich and creamy, with a velvety texture yet fully dry. It is an easy wine to drink now as there is no unnecessary weight. The finish is nice and round but fully dry. The complex limestone blend brings great acid balance and a certain weight. It should develop very nicely over the next few years.","price":"$45.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/467219-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8775000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fzind-humbrecht-calcaire-pinot-gris-2015%2F208573"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (175 degrees C).
