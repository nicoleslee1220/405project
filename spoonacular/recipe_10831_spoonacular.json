Meanwhile, in a pan large enough to take everything later (or just drain the sprouts and use their pan, once youve drained them), cook the pancetta cubes in the oil, with the rind for more salty fat rendering, until theyre bronzed and crisp, but not cooked to the point of having dried out.                                                    Add the butter and the chestnuts and, with a wooden spoon or spatula, press on the chestnuts to break them up a little. When theyre warmed through, turn the heat up and throw in the Marsala, letting it bubble away, fusing with the pancetta fat and chestnutty butter to form a glorious savory syrup. Add the drained sprouts and turn well, sprinkling in half the parsley as you do so. Give a good grinding of pepper; you shouldnt need salt, given the pancetta, but obviously taste to see.
