Heat a large (preferably 12- inch) skillet over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Pour in 2 Tbs. of the oil and swirl to coat the pan. As soon as the oil is shimmeringbut not smokingadd the fennel and onion in an even layer. Season with salt and pepper and let the vegetables cook undisturbed until they have begun to brown, about 2 minutes. Stir occasionally until the fennel and onion are tender and deep golden brown in places, about another 5 minutes. If the vegetables seem to be cooking too fast or the bottom of the pan is starting to burn, lower the heat to medium. (If using an electric stovetop, take the pan off the burner momentarily to let the pan cool.) Clear a space in the center of the pan and add the remaining 1/2 Tbs. oil and then the garlic. Let cook until the garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the orange juice and stir to combine with the vegetables. Pour the mixture over the arugula and toss to combine and to wilt the arugula. Season to taste with salt and pepper, sprinkle with the chopped olives and and serve immediately.
