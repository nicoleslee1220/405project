To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The 7Cellars Elway's Reserve Chardonnay with a 4.9 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 28 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":494532,"title":"7Cellars Elway's Reserve Chardonnay","description":"The 2018 Elway’s Reserve Carneros Chardonnay is well-balanced, exhibiting crisp tropical fruit, apple and pear flavors with light floral elements.

If they do, pull them out with a pair of tweezers or electricians pliers (be sure to clean them first). Also, remove the skin from the fillets and remove the shells and \"vein\" from the prawns.Lay a large piece of cling-film/plastic-wrap on a work surface, put the salmon on top of this and then lay another large piece of cling-film/plastic-wrap on top of the salmon.Using a rolling pin or the flat side of a meat hammer, gently flatten the salmon until it is about 1cm thick (be careful not to hit the salmon too hard as it crushes very easily).Remove the top layer of cling-film/plastic-wrap, chop the dill finely and sprinkle this over the salmon, then season it with salt & pepper.Flatten the sole fillets in the same way as the salmon but make it cm thick, then lay these on top of the salmon leaving a 3cm - 5cm gap along on side of the salmon.Lay the shelled prawns in a straight line down the middle of the sole fillets, then season with salt & pepper again.Using the cling-film/plastic-wrap, roll up the salmon into a neat sausage, starting at the opposite edge to the gap left by the sole fillets, then wrap it in another piece of cling-film/plastic-wrap and put it in the fridge for 30 minutes to set the shape.Preheat the oven to 210c.After 30 minutes, roll out the pastry to a thickness of about 2mm, remove the cling-film/plastic-wrap from the rolled salmon and place it on the pastry, a third of the way in from an edge.Fold the pastry over the salmon and roll it up until the pastry overlaps itself by 1cm, then cut off any excess.Seal the long edge of the pastry with a little water, fold the two open ends upwards onto the seam, seal them down with a little water and then turn the whole thing over, so the seam is underneath.Put the puff-pastry parcel onto a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper, mix the egg yolk with 1 teaspoon of water to make an eggwash and brush this onto the surface of the pastry.
