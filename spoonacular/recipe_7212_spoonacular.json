For perfect hard boiled eggs, just add 2 eggs to a pot of cold water. Bring the water to a boil, cover then take them off the heat for 8 minutes. Drain and immediately soak in a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking. Peel the eggs, roughly chop and add to the buckwheat.Mix the oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper in a small bowl and pour the dressing over the buckwheat and eggs. Toss to evenly coat.To make the yogurt sauce, just combine all the ingredients in a small bowl. You can make the filling and the sauce up to a day in advance and keep them in the fridge.When you're ready to make the rolls, thoroughly wash the lettuce then stack them in a hot steamer. Cook for about a minute or until the leaves have wilted (the rib running down the middle will still be hard). Transfer to a bowl of cold water then gently squeeze the excess water out of the leaves.Lay a lettuce leaf on a prep surface and gently unfold the leafy part (see first photo below). Using a sharp knife, cut about 1/3 of the center rib out as shown in the photo below. Place some crumbled smoked trout along the middle 1/3rd and top with a few small spoonfuls of the buckwheat egg mixture (see second photo below).Fold the flaps (where you cut the rib out) over the filling and across each other (see the photos below). Fold other side of the leaf in the same way then roll the leaf using your fingers to hold the stuffing in.To serve, just top with the yogurt sauce and chopped pine nuts. If you're taking them on a picnic it will probably be easier to dip the rolls in the sauce like a spring roll.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Follow the package directions to make 2 C of cooked buckwheat.
