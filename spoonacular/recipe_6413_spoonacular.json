Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Zind-Humbrecht Calcaire Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 46 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":467219,"title":"Zind-Humbrecht Calcaire Pinot Gris","description":"Bright yellow/gold color, quite luminous. Superb smoky toasty nose, typical for this grape on limestone in Alsace (no new oak in our wines, just very long total lees contact). Some light reductive aromas that actually fit the style of dry Pinot-Gris. The palate is rich and creamy, with a velvety texture yet fully dry. It is an easy wine to drink now as there is no unnecessary weight. The finish is nice and round but fully dry. The complex limestone blend brings great acid balance and a certain weight. It should develop very nicely over the next few years.","price":"$45.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/467219-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8775000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fzind-humbrecht-calcaire-pinot-gris-2015%2F208573"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 450-degrees F.Brush 4 ovenproof plates with olive oil and then sprinkle with kosher salt and white pepper.Divide fish among the four plates, skin side up in the center of the plates.Brush fish with olive oil and then sprinkle with salt and pepper.Press wax paper over fish.Chop herbs in a processor and then pour in three tablespoons olive oil through food tube while the machine is running.Transfer to small bowl or dish and stir in lemon juice, salt and pepper.Set aside.Bake fish for 4 minutes.Remove plates from oven, discard wax papper.Let plates stand for 30 seconds and then spoon 2 tablespoons herb mixture along each piece of fish.Serve with rice pilaf and green vegetables.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 450-degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Brush 4 ovenproof plates with olive oil and then sprinkle with kosher salt and white pepper.Divide fish among the four plates, skin side up in the center of the plates.","ingredients":[{"id":2032,"name":"white pepper","localizedName":"white pepper","image":"white-pepper.png"},{"id":1082047,"name":"kosher salt","localizedName":"kosher salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Brush fish with olive oil and then sprinkle with salt and pepper.Press wax paper over fish.Chop herbs in a processor and then pour in three tablespoons olive oil through food tube while the machine is running.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","localizedName":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":1002044,"name":"herbs","localizedName":"herbs","image":"mixed-fresh-herbs.jpg"},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404739,"name":"wax paper","localizedName":"wax paper","image":"wax-paper.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Transfer to small bowl or dish and stir in lemon juice, salt and pepper.Set aside.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","localizedName":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","localizedName":"lemon juice","image":"lemon-juice.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":5,"step":"Bake fish for 4 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}],"length":{"number":4,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":6,"step":"Remove plates from oven, discard wax papper.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":7,"step":"Let plates stand for 30 seconds and then spoon 2 tablespoons herb mixture along each piece of fish.","ingredients":[{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":8,"step":"Serve with rice pilaf and green vegetables.","ingredients":[{"id":11583,"name":"vegetable","localizedName":"vegetable","image":"mixed-vegetables.png"},{"id":20444,"name":"rice","localizedName":"rice","image":"uncooked-white-rice.png"}],"equipment":[]}]}],"originalId":null}
