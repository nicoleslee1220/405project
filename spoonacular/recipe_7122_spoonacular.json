Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The St. Michael-Eppan Anger Pinot Grigio with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 23 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":490914,"title":"St. Michael-Eppan Anger Pinot Grigio","description":"Depending on the soil and microclimate, Pinot gris varies from a simple everyday wine all the way up to absolute top growths. The warm, sun-exposed vineyards of the Anger sites, with their loamy limestone gravel soils, are a textbook example. The Anger Alto Adige Pinot Grigio has a noble structure, nice balance and fine acidity – making it an absolute pleasure to drink. The strong white goes well with fish and fish soup, guinea fowl breast or veal fillet.","price":"$22.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/490914-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":22.0,"score":0.8450746268656716,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fst-michael-eppan-anger-pinot-grigio-2018%2F535614"}]},"instructions":"Set oven to broiler heat.Grease a broiler pan, then line with foil and grease the foil slightly.In a small bowl mix together Parmesan cheese, butter, mayo, lemon juice and garlic.Add in all the remaining seasonings and salt if using; mix well and set aside.Arrange the fillets in a single layer on the prepared pan (you sprinkle salt on fish but it is not necessary).Broil a few inches from the heat for about 2-3 minutes.Turn the fish over and broil a couple minutes more.Remove from oven and cover them with the Parmesan mixture on the top side only.Return to oven and broil for about 2 minutes more or until the topping is browned and the fish flakes easily (do not overcook the fish!).","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Set oven to broiler heat.Grease a broiler pan, then line with foil and grease the foil slightly.In a small bowl mix together Parmesan cheese, butter, mayo, lemon juice and garlic.","ingredients":[{"id":1033,"name":"parmesan","localizedName":"parmesan","image":"parmesan.jpg"},{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","localizedName":"lemon juice","image":"lemon-juice.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","localizedName":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","localizedName":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":4025,"name":"mayonnaise","localizedName":"mayonnaise","image":"mayonnaise.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404698,"name":"broiler pan","localizedName":"broiler pan","image":"broiler-pan.jpg"},{"id":405914,"name":"broiler","localizedName":"broiler","image":"oven.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"},{"id":404765,"name":"aluminum foil","localizedName":"aluminum foil","image":"aluminum-foil.png"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add in all the remaining seasonings and salt if using; mix well and set aside.Arrange the fillets in a single layer on the prepared pan (you sprinkle salt on fish but it is not necessary).Broil a few inches from the heat for about 2-3 minutes.Turn the fish over and broil a couple minutes more.","ingredients":[{"id":1042027,"name":"seasoning","localizedName":"seasoning","image":"seasoning.png"},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Remove from oven and cover them with the Parmesan mixture on the top side only.Return to oven and broil for about 2 minutes more or until the topping is browned and the fish flakes easily (do not overcook the fish!).","ingredients":[{"id":1033,"name":"parmesan","localizedName":"parmesan","image":"parmesan.jpg"},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}}]}],"originalId":null}
