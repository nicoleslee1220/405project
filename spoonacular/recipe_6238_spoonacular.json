Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The GIFFT by Kathie Lee Gifford Pinot Grigio with a 4.8 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 15 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":482242,"title":"GIFFT by Kathie Lee Gifford Pinot Grigio","description":"GIFFT Pinot Grigio bursts with lively pear and tropical fruits, balanced by crisp acidity and an elegantly refined freshness.

Season with salt to taste.    Pull out any bones in the fish with needlenose pliers or tweezers. Season both sides of the fish with salt and dredge very lightly in the flour. Heat 2 Tbs. oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. When hot, add two of the fillets, skin side up; cook until light golden brown, 4 to 5 min. With a thin slottedmetal spatula, turn the fish and cook until the second side is lightly browned and the fish is cooked through, about 3 min. Transfer the fillets, skin side down, to a plate, cover to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining fillets.    Stir the vinaigrette, toss enough of it with the arugula to coat lightly (1 to 2 Tbs.), and portion it among four plates. Lay the fish on top, spoon the remaining vinaigrette over the fillets, and serve with a wedge of lemon.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Size                        :                      based on four servings, Calories                        (kcal):                      450, Fat                        (kcal):                      29, Fat Calories                        (g):                      260, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      4, Protein                        (g):                      35, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      21, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      10, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      3, Sodium                        (g):                      760, Cholesterol                        (g):                      60, Fiber                        (g):                      1,                     Photo: Scott Phillips          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Mix the olives, 1/3 cup of the oil, the lemon zest, lemon juice, garlic, and chile flakes in a small bowl with a fork; the vinaigrette doesnt need to emulsify.
