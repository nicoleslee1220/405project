To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Trentadue La Storia Chardonnay with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":437477,"title":"Trentadue La Storia Chardonnay","description":"The 2014 Chardonnay, Sonoma Coast, is typical for the variety with aromas of apples, white peaches and citrus. With longer time in the glass nuanced aromas of nutmeg, slight toast and vanilla come to play along with suggestion of pineapple and ripe Meyer lemons. The mouth feel is crisp and restrained with clear minerality and purity of fruit.
