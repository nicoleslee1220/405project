Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. You could try Mazzei Fonterutoli Chianti Classico. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 32 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":471586,"title":"Mazzei Fonterutoli Chianti Classico","description":"\"Lots of meat, berry and plum character on the nose and palate. Full-bodied, with velvety tannins and a long, rich finish. Decadent style that I like. Serious quality for the vintage. No Castello in 2002, so this was upgraded.\"-Wine SpectatorColor: Deep purplish-red but bright and exceptionally concentrated.Bouquet: Extremely intense and complex with scents of cherries and raspberries accompanied by light toasty and spicy shadings.Flavor: The impact in the mouth is incisive but soft due to a substantial structure of tannins in which those that are soft and well rounded stand out. Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.","price":"$31.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/471586-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":8.0,"score":0.8400000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fmazzei-fonterutoli-chianti-classico-2015%2F348432"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"originalId":null}
