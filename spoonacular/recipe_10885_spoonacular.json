Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. One wine you could try is Nickel & Nickel Harris Vineyard Merlot. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 40 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":442492,"title":"Nickel & Nickel Harris Vineyard Merlot","description":"Bright red fruits, candied blueberry, Santa Rosa plum and menthol aromas all blend together to intoxicate the nose as the 2016 Harris Vineyard Merlot wafts from the glass.
