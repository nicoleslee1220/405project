Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. The Miranda Lambert County Road Merlot Wine with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 28 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428265,"title":"Miranda Lambert County Road Merlot Wine","description":"Our most robust spirit is full of fruity flavor and powerful color yet smooth in texture and delivery. With its ripe berry essence the aroma lingers as long as the explosive finish.

Saut or grill over medium-high heat 5 to 7 minutes or until desired degree of doneness. (Fish can also be baked or broiled.) Let stand 5 minutes, and slice.                                                                                                Spread one-fourth of the hummus evenly over each tortilla. Place spinach on hummus. Arrange roasted bell pepper and tuna evenly over spinach.                                                                                                Roll wrap, and serve immediately. If serving later, wrap in plastic wrap and chill.                                                                                                Note: Look at color first when shopping for tuna. Steaks range from pink to deep red, depending on the species. Never purchase tan or brown tuna. A darker band running along large loin pieces is perfectly normal but may have a strong taste. You can substitute many kinds of seafood--or even chicken--for tuna in this sandwich. For a healthy boost, try grilled salmon.                                                                                                Wine note: The newly released Beaulieu Vineyard Coastal Estates Pinot Grigio offers delicate floral aromas with peach and melon notes. This lighter white wine pairs well with the ahi, hummus, and bell pepper flavors. Or try Beaulieu's Sauvignon Blanc, a natural match with the lean, clean taste of the tuna. It also complements the creamy yogurt and aromatic mint in the side dishes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Brush both sides of tuna with olive oil; sprinkle with seasoning.
