Try pairing with Bordeaux, Champagne, and White Burgundy. French wine is just as diverse as French food, but you rarely go wrong with champagne. If your meal calls for a white wine, you might also try a white burgundy. For a red, try a red bordeaux blend. The Clarendelle Inspired by Haut-Brion Bordeaux ( half-bottle) with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

The wine has violet and slightly toasty nuances on the palate. The texture is velvety and the flavour altogether powerful and elegant.

Crumble or flake the fish into a bowl using two forks (one in each hand moving away from each other in the bowl) or your hands if you prefer. If the top of your fillet has a hard crust from the smoking process, you can pick out the larger, hard bits if you prefer. I like to leave in most, as they have the smoky flavor, but I try to make sure to break them down.                                  Add cottage cheese and crme frache and mix well with a spoon. If the mixture seems dry, add another dollop of cottage cheese. I like a smooth consistency so using the back of the spoon, I \"smooth out\" some of the cottage cheese curds against the side of the bowl.                                  Sprinkle a pinch of salt (if your fish isn't particularly salty), a couple of grinds of pepper and the horseradish and mix well.                                    Add the chives, reserving a pinch for a garnish. Mix gently.                                  Put into serving bowl and sprinkle the remaining chives on top. If not serving right away, refrigerate, but take it out about 1/2 hour before serving so it can come to room temperature which will make spreading easier. Serve with thin slices of baguette or crispy toast crackers.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Remove the skin from the fish and discard.
