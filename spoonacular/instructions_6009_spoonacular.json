[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Inspiration can come from a variety of sources. It can strike when I'm browsing the Farmers Market, or flipping through a cooking magazine, or falling asleep at night, dreaming of the things I want to eat the next day. It's an elusive and wonderful thing, inspiration, and when it strikes, you have to seize on it.The September 2010 issue of \"Food & Wine\" magazine takes on Southern cooking in a modern and delightful way. I've been whipping up several recipes inspired by their articles, including this one for Smoky Shrimp with Grits.Last weekend, bored with the same old lunch, I made this shrimp dish, a warm hearty meal, perfect for the start of football season (Kuzak is a massive UMich fan). I always keep raw, frozen shrimp in my freezer. Lately, I've been enjoying pink Gulf Coast shrimp (while I can). The shrimp is sauteed with garlic and smoked paprika, which turns into a lovely red-tinged sauce when reduced with wine, and served over grits with roasted heirloom cherry tomatoes and goat cheese. I served it with a plate of lovely mixed greens.This dish would be great for lunch or dinner (it cooks up in a jiffy), and pairs best with a rich California Chardonnay.
