After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. One wine you could try is Rabble Merlot. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 20 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":480936,"title":"Rabble Merlot","description":"Sporting black cherry, dark berry, malt chocolate with nuanced French Oak notes of vanilla and mocha.
