Drain and add to a heavy bottomed pot along with the water. Bring the pot to a boil, then cover with a lid and turn down the heat to low and set a timer for 15 minutes. When the timer goes off, turn off the stove and let the rice steam for another 10 minutes, dont open the lid during this time. In a small bowl, whisk the vinegar, sugar and salt together. When the rice is done, dump it into a large bowl and cover with the vinegar mixture. Using a large spatula and fan, fold the vinegar into the rice while cooling the mixture with the fan.  Keep fanning until the rice comes to room temperature. In a bowl, combine the minced toro with 3/4 of the scallions and the sesame seeds and stir to combine.  Prepare a small bowl of water to dip your fingers in to prevent the rice from sticking to them.Lay the nori, shiny side down on the bamboo matt. Wet your fingertips and lay down a thin layer of rice about 3/4 of the way up the nori. The rice will be sticky but just keep wetting your hands and gently press the rice outward with your fingertips to make it thin. Be careful not to overwork the rice or it will get mushy. Spoon some negitoro across the edge of the rice closest to you from one end to the other. Hook your thumbs below the bamboo mat and roll the edge up and over the filling. Dont squeeze the roll at this point or the negitoro wont stay in place. Continue rolling, being careful not to roll the mat along with the sushi. When you've reached the end, give the roll a good squeeze from all around to set the shape of the rice. You should end up with a slightly square roll. Using a very sharp long knife (a sushi knife is ideal), score the roll at the midpoint, then score the middle of each half, then score the middle of each quarter (you should have 8 segments).","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the sushi rice, wash the rice in a sieve until the water is almost clear.","ingredients":[{"id":10220054,"name":"sushi rice","localizedName":"sushi rice","image":"uncooked-white-rice.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":20444,"name":"rice","localizedName":"rice","image":"uncooked-white-rice.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":405600,"name":"sieve","localizedName":"sieve","image":"strainer.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Drain and add to a heavy bottomed pot along with the water.
