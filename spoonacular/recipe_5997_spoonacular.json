Buttery chardonnay is great for scallops, shrimp, crab, and lobster, while muscadet is a classic pick for mussels, oysters, and clams. If you've got some spice in your shellfish, a semi-dry riesling can balance out the heat. One wine you could try is A to Z Chardonnay. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 15 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":444065,"title":"A to Z Chardonnay","description":"The 2010 A to Z Chardonnay opens with aromas of white flowers, tangerine, lime, quince, wet stone and minerals that develop further into nutmeg, honey, green apple with hints of ginger. A mineral laden attack is bright, mouthwatering and intense. The nuanced mid-palate carries on with flavors that mirror and amplify the aromatics. The finish is long, clean, crisp and juicy with flavors of honeysuckle, citrus and wet stone. This wine exemplifies classic Oregon steely Chardonnay. 2010 was an exceptional vintage for white wines in Oregon and this sophisticated terroir driven wine is no exception; bright, tangy and intense it will deliver over the next 5 years.","price":"$14.95","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/444065-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8400000000000001,"ratingCount":7.0,"score":0.7945454545454547,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fa-to-z-chardonnay-2010%2F117168"}]},"instructions":"If using regular yogurt, place it in a strainer lined with paper towel and set the strainer over a bowl.
