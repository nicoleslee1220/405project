Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Menage a Trois Limelight Pinot Grigio.

Whisk together, season with salt to taste. Set in the refrigerator to chill while you prepare the fish.Rinse your fish fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle each fillet on the front and back lightly with salt and pepper.Dredge the fillets in flour or gluten free flour, making sure the fillets are evenly and completely coated with a thin layer of flour.Sprinkle the fillets on both sides with paprika.Heat oil in a skillet over medium till hot enough for frying. Add fillets to the skillet. If the oil is at the correct temperature, it should bubble and sizzle evenlyno splatters or popping. Do not crowd the pan, this will drop the oil temperature and make it more difficult to turn the fish. You may need to fry in batches to keep from crowding the pan.Fry the fish for about 3 minutes on each side, till the coating is golden brown on both sides and the fish is cooked through.Set the fried fish fillets on a double layer of paper towels to drain. Serve warm fish fillets topped with the cool, creamy Greek yogurt mint sauce. Garnish each fillet with a bit of chopped fresh mint.
