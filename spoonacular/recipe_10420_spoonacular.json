Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. One wine you could try is Casan Emma Chianti Classico. It has 4.8 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 21 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":439134,"title":"Casa Emma Chianti Classico","description":"Casa Emma Chianti Classico D.O.C.G is an elegant wine with a floreal bouquet and cherry hints.
