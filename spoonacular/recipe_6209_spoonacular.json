Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Mark West Pinot Grigio with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":490366,"title":"Mark West Pinot Grigio","description":"Crisp and clean, this wine features honeydew, stone fruit, and citrus with a subtle, clean, lingering finish.\nTry pairing with good old fish and chips, summer salads, and steamed clams by the dozen...or dozens.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/490366-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9,"ratingCount":7.0,"score":0.8545454545454546,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fmark-west-pinot-grigio-2017%2F510897"}]},"instructions":"Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, and saut for 1 minute, or until browned. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion, and saut for 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, 1 teaspoon salt, crushed red pepper, and black pepper. Cook 8 minutes (partially mash the tomatoes with a fork after 5 minutes). Pour in the wine and 1 cup water, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a low simmer. Place the fillets, skin sides up, on top of the tomato mixture. Cover and cook 15 minutes, or just until the fish is opaque and cooked through (do not turn or break up the fillets).
