Thinly slice the tenderloin on a diagonal into 8 pieces. Pound the slices to a 1/4-inch thickness. Place the flour on a plate. Place the eggs in a shallow bowl and beat lightly. In a separate bowl, combine the bread crumbs, salt, and Parmesan. Working in batches, lightly coat the cutlets first in the flour, then in the egg mixture (allowing any excess to drip off), and finally in the bread crumb mixture. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 4 of the cutlets. Cook until golden, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Place the cutlets on a baking sheet. Wipe out the skillet and repeat with the remaining olive oil and cutlets. Transfer to oven and heat until the pork is cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Divide the arugula and tomatoes among individual plates and drizzle with the extra-virgin olive oil. Serve with the cutlets and lemon wedges.Tip: When it's not peak tomato season, try using intensely flavored Roma (plum) tomatoes instead of tomatoes on the vine. Use 2 Romas for each regular tomato.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat oven to 400 F. Thinly slice the tenderloin on a diagonal into 8 pieces.
