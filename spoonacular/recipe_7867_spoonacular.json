Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. One wine you could try is Miranda Lambert County Road Merlot Wine. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 28 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428265,"title":"Miranda Lambert County Road Merlot Wine","description":"Our most robust spirit is full of fruity flavor and powerful color yet smooth in texture and delivery.

Season the tuna with salt and pepper. Grill over a hot fire, turning once, until lightly charred on the outside and rare inside, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a platter. Brush the ciabatta slices on both sides with olive oil and grill over a hot fire until toasted on both sides.                                               Cut the tuna into 1/3-inch-thick slices and arrange the slices on the toasts. Top each bruschetta with a dollop of chipotle crme frache and a basil leaf and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large, shallow dish, combine the cider and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"cider","localizedName":"cider","image":""}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the tuna steaks and turn to coat.","ingredients":[{"id":0,"name":"tuna steak","localizedName":"tuna steak","image":"tuna-steak.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Let stand for 15 minutes, turning once.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":15,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Meanwhile, light a grill.
