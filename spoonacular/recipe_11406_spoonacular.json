In a large, deep skillet, heat the oil. Add the ginger and garlic and cook over low heat just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the cabbage and cook over low heat, tossing, until wilted, about 5 minutes. Add the stock and season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook the cabbage until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the chives.                                              Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the orange juice, honey, thyme, coriander seeds and cinnamon stick and bring to a boil. Simmer over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until reduced to a glaze, about 10 minutes; strain.                                              Heat a large ovenproof skillet. Using a sharp knife, score the duck skin in a cross-hatch pattern and season with salt and pepper. Add the duck to the skillet, skin side down, and cook over low heat until the skin is golden, about 20 minutes. Spoon off the fat as it accumulates in the pan. Turn the duck over and brush the skin with the glaze. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast the duck for about 6 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of a breast registers 135. Let the duck rest for 5 minutes, then transfer to plates. Rewarm the cabbage and serve it alongside the duck.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 40","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"In a large, deep skillet, heat the oil.","ingredients":[{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the ginger and garlic and cook over low heat just until fragrant, about 1 minute.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","localizedName":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":11216,"name":"ginger","localizedName":"ginger","image":"ginger.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":1,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Add the cabbage and cook over low heat, tossing, until wilted, about 5 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11109,"name":"cabbage","localizedName":"cabbage","image":"cabbage.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":5,"step":"Add the stock and season with salt and pepper.
