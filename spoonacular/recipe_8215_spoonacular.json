Take tomatoes, apple, and garlic and place in a food processor to blend until chunky. I blended mine quite a bit and it was very soupy looking. If you dont have a processor, you can always just chop everything up! Chop up onion, green pepper, and banana and throw into slow cooker followed by the rest of the ingredients. Stir well. Cook on low for several hours. Adjust salt level to taste as it cooks, and let the house fill with the smell of curry.Optional add ins: Add unsweetened coconut, rice and raisins, or peanuts.I will admit, I was quite terrified when I saw what it looked like before mixing:Dear God what have I done???The pureed tomatoes made the sauce pinkish when it came out of the processor! Have no fear though because the curry will turn it a nice orange colour. :)This was my first time using amaranth seeds! I picked some up at bulk barn after seeing how great the nutritional profile was.In just 1/4 cup cooked seeds there is 7 grams of fibre and 7 grams of protein!I used 1/2 cup uncooked and threw it in.They are so CUTE! How could I eat them?I cooked it on medium for about 4 hours or so. The smell in the house was amazing when we got home!!!But how did it taste?I mean, lets not forget there are banana slices and apple in this curry!!!I was worried that I wouldnt like it because I have never been one to mix sweet and savoury flavours togetherBut wouldnt you know it this dish rocked my socks!!!!!Wow wow wow wow. Seriously wow. I had two full bowls and could have devoured more! It was the perfect dinner tonight because we are getting some crazy T-storms and it felt so warm and comforting. :)The chunks of banana were out of this world amazing!!!The amaranth seeds really made this dish extra awesome. It gave the dish a nice texture! I also loved the green pepper. Next time I will throw in more veggies too!With Marys Crackers:Ive already finished a box and I am well into the second! HELP ME!I also had a new tea tonight: Eaters DigestI loved the tea! No tummy pains after eating. Not to say that I always do, but I do suffer from indigestion at times.My project tonight was putting together a picture frame that my mom and stepdad gave us a long time ago!!I filled it with wedding pictures. :) I love looking at pictures. It has got to be one of my top 5 things to do- so many memories and nostalgia!Starting at the top and going clockwise: Me (a bride!!), Me and dad, Eric, I and our wedding party, me and OSGMOM, The entire group!It now sits on our fireplace but I am contemplating putting it on my desk in the office since this is where I spend the majority of my time! Maybe I will move it to the fireplace when guests visit. ;)Thanks for all of your suggestions about the race snacks!! Wow, what would I do without your great help! Seriously, thank you. I have lots of ideas now and just hoping I have enough time to do everything I am envisioning.1. I cant believe Eric and I missed Lenos farewell/Conans introduction last night!!! I just watched some video online. Oh, I love me some Conan!!!!2. Only 1 day left of the BBBC!!!3. Exactly 2 weeks until my 10k race!I think Im going to warm up a Blueberry Oat Streusel Muffin nowmuahuaha.Tonights question: Are you a curry lover?I actually never tried curry until the end of 2008 and now I am hooked!
