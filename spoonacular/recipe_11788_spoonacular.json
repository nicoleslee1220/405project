To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Tyler Winery Santa Barbara County Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 30 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":444215,"title":"Tyler Winery Santa Barbara County Chardonnay","description":"2015 brought the earliest vintage of the decade so far.
