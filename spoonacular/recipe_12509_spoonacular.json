Add the celery leaves, onion top and carrot tops to the water.Slowly simmer the clove-studded leek, celery leaves, onion top and carrot tops in the water, uncovered, until the chicken is completely cooked and tender to the bone, about two hours.Once the chicken is tender, remove it from the the stockpot and allow it to cool.  Remove the bay leaves, celery leaves, onion top and carrot tops from the broth, straining it if necessary.  Discard the vegetable matter, but continue simmering the broth, uncovered, while you prepare the remaining ingredients.As the chicken cools, prepare the vegetables by peeling and mincing the carrots and mincing the onion and celery stalks as well.Melt the butter in a cast iron skillet until it foams, and toss the minced vegetables into the pan.  Fry the vegetables in butter until they become fragrant and tender, about five minutes.  Remove them from the heat and allow them to cool.Once the chicken has cooled, remove its meat, saving the bones to roast for another round of stock.Place the chicken meat and cooled vegetables into a food processor and pulse until they’re finely ground.  If you have no food processor, you can mince the chicken and vegetables finely.Stir the vegetables and chicken meat back into the simmering broth and turn off the stove.Temper the beaten eggs by stirring a spoonful of broth into the eggs, then pouring the mixture of eggs and broth into the simmering soup.Gently stir two cups of heavy cream into the broth and serve, dressed with minced fresh herbs and seasoned with unrefined sea salt.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Rinse the chicken thoroughly and pat it dry before placing it in your stock pot, covering it completely with fresh, clean and very cold water (about one and one-half gallons).Stud the leek with whole cloves, and place it in the stock pot along side the stewing chicken.","ingredients":[{"id":1002011,"name":"whole clove","localizedName":"whole clove","image":"cloves.jpg"},{"id":5006,"name":"whole chicken","localizedName":"whole chicken","image":"whole-chicken.jpg"},{"id":1006615,"name":"stock","localizedName":"stock","image":"chicken-broth.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":11246,"name":"leek","localizedName":"leek","image":"leeks.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","localizedName":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the celery leaves, onion top and carrot tops to the water.Slowly simmer the clove-studded leek, celery leaves, onion top and carrot tops in the water, uncovered, until the chicken is completely cooked and tender to the bone, about two hours.Once the chicken is tender, remove it from the the stockpot and allow it to cool.","ingredients":[{"id":10011143,"name":"celery leaves","localizedName":"celery leaves","image":"celery-leaves.jpg"},{"id":99107,"name":"carrot leaves","localizedName":"carrot leaves","image":"carrot-leaves.jpg"},{"id":5006,"name":"whole chicken","localizedName":"whole chicken","image":"whole-chicken.jpg"},{"id":1002011,"name":"clove","localizedName":"clove","image":"cloves.jpg"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","localizedName":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":0,"name":"bone","localizedName":"bone","image":""},{"id":11246,"name":"leek","localizedName":"leek","image":"leeks.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","localizedName":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}],"length":{"number":120,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Remove the bay leaves, celery leaves, onion top and carrot tops from the broth, straining it if necessary.
