Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Santi Sortesele Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":481300,"title":"Santi Sortesele Pinot Grigio","description":"Straw yellow hue, accompanied by a close-focused nose of pear, apricot and white flowers.
