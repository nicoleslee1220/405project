Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"In a small bowl, combine the olive oil with the parsley, crushed red pepper and sea salt.                                              In a large deep skillet, heat the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onion and garlic and cook over moderately high heat until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the wine and cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Add the tomato sauce, clam broth and 1 1/2 tablespoons of the Tuscan Hot Oil and bring to a boil. Add the shrimp, mussels and cockles and cook, uncovered, until the shells are just beginning to open and the shrimp start to curl, about 2 minutes. Add the scallops and snapper and cook until the shells are nearly all opened and the fish is nearly cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Add the squid and cook until opaque, about 1 minute.                                              Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the bucatini until al dente. Drain the pasta well.                                              Transfer the pasta to a large bowl and toss with the seafood and its sauce. Serve the pasta, passing the remaining Tuscan Hot Oil at the table for drizzling.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small bowl, combine the olive oil with the parsley, crushed red pepper and sea salt.","ingredients":[{"id":1032009,"name":"red pepper flakes","localizedName":"red pepper flakes","image":"red-pepper-flakes.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":1012047,"name":"sea salt","localizedName":"sea salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":11297,"name":"parsley","localizedName":"parsley","image":"parsley.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"In a large deep skillet, heat the olive oil until shimmering.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the onion and garlic and cook over moderately high heat until softened, about 5 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","localizedName":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","localizedName":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Add the wine and cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":14084,"name":"wine","localizedName":"wine","image":"red-wine.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":5,"step":"Add the tomato sauce, clam broth and 1 1/2 tablespoons of the Tuscan Hot Oil and bring to a boil.","ingredients":[{"id":11549,"name":"tomato sauce","localizedName":"tomato sauce","image":"tomato-sauce-or-pasta-sauce.jpg"},{"id":1006615,"name":"broth","localizedName":"broth","image":"chicken-broth.png"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":6,"step":"Add the shrimp, mussels and cockles and cook, uncovered, until the shells are just beginning to open and the shrimp start to curl, about 2 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":35028,"name":"cockles","localizedName":"cockles","image":"cockles.jpg"},{"id":15164,"name":"mussels","localizedName":"mussels","image":"mussels.jpg"},{"id":11020420,"name":"pasta shells","localizedName":"pasta shells","image":"shell-pasta.jpg"},{"id":15270,"name":"shrimp","localizedName":"shrimp","image":"shrimp.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":7,"step":"Add the scallops and snapper and cook until the shells are nearly all opened and the fish is nearly cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes longer.","ingredients":[{"id":10015172,"name":"scallops","localizedName":"scallops","image":"scallops.jpg"},{"id":15101,"name":"snapper","localizedName":"snapper","image":"snapper.jpg"},{"id":11020420,"name":"pasta shells","localizedName":"pasta shells","image":"shell-pasta.jpg"},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":8,"step":"Add the squid and cook until opaque, about 1 minute.","ingredients":[{"id":15175,"name":"squid","localizedName":"squid","image":"calamari-or-squid.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":1,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":9,"step":"Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the bucatini until al dente.","ingredients":[{"id":11620420,"name":"bucatini","localizedName":"bucatini","image":"bucatini.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","localizedName":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":10,"step":"Drain the pasta well.","ingredients":[{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","localizedName":"pasta","image":"fusilli.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":11,"step":"Transfer the pasta to a large bowl and toss with the seafood and its sauce.","ingredients":[{"id":0,"name":"seafood","localizedName":"seafood","image":"shrimp.png"},{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","localizedName":"pasta","image":"fusilli.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"sauce","localizedName":"sauce","image":""}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":12,"step":"Serve the pasta, passing the remaining Tuscan Hot Oil at the table for drizzling.","ingredients":[{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","localizedName":"pasta","image":"fusilli.jpg"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]}],"originalId":null}
