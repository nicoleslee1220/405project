Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. You could try Avalon Napa Merlot. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 11 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":440668,"title":"Avalon Napa Merlot","description":"The 2010 Merlot shows its depth with a rich garnet color. Aromas of plum, peach compote, tobacco, rhubarb and anise fill the glass. Caramelized sugar and vanilla notes from oak aging complement the ripe fruit aromas. Mountain fruit characteristics show the intensity of the fruit flavors. The entry enjoys sweet berry notes of olallieberry, followed by a finish of blackberry preserves. The oak imparted flavors of mocha and toasted brioche, which pair with and complement the rich fruit layers. Refined tannins support this balanced wine. As this medium/heavy weight Merlot develops in the glass, one may enjoy ongoing juicy, dark berry notes, a touch of cocoa spice evolving in the middle and a lingering finish.","price":"$10.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440668-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8175000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Favalon-napa-merlot-2010%2F114607"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"originalId":null}
