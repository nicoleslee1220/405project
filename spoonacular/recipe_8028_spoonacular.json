Bake for 15 minutes until the wontons crisp up and the edges get golden. Using a spatula, remove the wonton crisps to a platter to let them cool.                          Blanch the soy beans in boiling salted water for 5 minutes. Drain, then pinch the beans out of their pods and put them in a food processor. Add the wasabi, salt, lemon juice, and water.

Whisk together the soy sauce, sake, brown sugar and chili paste until the sugar dissolves. Arrange the sliced tuna in a single layer in a shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the tuna, cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Don't marinate the tuna any longer because it will start to \"cook\" and the texture will be mushy.                          To put these little gems together, dollop a spoonful of the edamame puree on the wonton crisp then lay a slice of tuna on the top.
