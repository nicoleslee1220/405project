After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Robert Mondavi Napa Merlot with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 30 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438573,"title":"Robert Mondavi Napa Merlot","description":"The wine's multi-dimensional flavors come from grapes grown in distinctly different terroirs of Napa Valley, including the Carneros, Stags Leap and Oakville districts. Traditional techniques, including native yeasts, extended maceration, aging in French oak barrels and bottling without filtration, enhanced the wine's complexity. This wine is delicious with many entrees and cheeses. One of our favorite food pairings is roast turkey with a wild mushroom and walnut stuffing. Roast leg of lamb, rubbed with fragrant herbs and spices, or grilled pork loin also marry perfectly with the wine's luscious flavors.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438573-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":25.0,"score":0.7868421052631579,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Frobert-mondavi-napa-merlot-1999%2F51817"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 350. Rub the roast with 1/2 tablespoon of the oil and season with salt and pepper. Heat a large ovenproof skillet until very hot. Add the roast and cook over high heat, turning occasionally, until well-browned all over, about 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the butter, garlic and thyme. Spoon the butter mixture over the meat and roast, basting, for about 20 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center registers 125. Let rest for 20 minutes.                                              In a medium saucepan of boiling water, blanch the brussels sprout leaves for 20 seconds. Drain and pat dry. In a skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the chestnuts and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until golden, 3 minutes. Add the pear and sprout leaves and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Sprinkle with the Sichuan peppercorns and season with salt.                                              Untie the roast and carve it across the grain into thin slices. Garnish with the chestnuts, pear and brussels sprouts.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 35","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Rub the roast with 1/2 tablespoon of the oil and season with salt and pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","localizedName":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"},{"id":1012034,"name":"dry seasoning rub","localizedName":"dry seasoning rub","image":"seasoning.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Heat a large ovenproof skillet until very hot.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the roast and cook over high heat, turning occasionally, until well-browned all over, about 12 minutes.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":12,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":5,"step":"Remove from the heat and add the butter, garlic and thyme.
