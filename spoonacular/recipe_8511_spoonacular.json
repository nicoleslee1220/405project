Cut off the top of a head of garlic, drizzle with some olive oil, wrap in foil, and roast for 30-40 minutes, or until soft.  Once cool, squeeze out roasted garlic into a bowl and set aside.                                  Whisk honey into hot tap water (or nuke filtered water to 100 degrees), and mix in one packet of yeast.  Allow yeast to proof (foam up) for about 5 minutes.  In the meantime, add one cup of the flour and salt to a food processor and pulse several times.  Once yeast mixture is foamy and thick, turn on the food processor and drizzle yeast mixture into the flour in a slow and steady stream until the flour just starts to stick together into a cohesive ball.  You might not need all of the yeast mixture, and you do not want to add more liquid than needed,  Remove the dough from the food processor and knead the dough on a floured surface for 2-3 minutes,  Once dough is elastic and no longer sticky, place it in a small bowl and drizzle with olive oil until the entire dough ball is covered.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and allow to rise for 1-2 hours.                                   While dough is rising, heat the oven to 500 degrees, and place your pizza stone in the bottom of the oven.  Once the dough has risen, punch it down, and press dough out on a floured surface into the shape of a circle.  Place cornmeal onto your pizza peel, and place the dough on top.  Drizzle dough with some olive oil, and spread with roasted garlic and season with salt, pepper and Italian seasonings.  Add cheese.  Place dough onto heated pizza stone and bake for 5-10 minutes or until cheese is melted and crust is brown.                                    Remove pizza from oven onto pizza peel.  Toss arugula with olive oil, salt and pepper, and cover the pizza with the arugula mixture and allow to wilt.
