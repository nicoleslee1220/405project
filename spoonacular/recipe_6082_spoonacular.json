Bring the mixture to a boil and slowly whisk in the grits. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover the saucepan and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes, or until thickened. Stir in the cheddar cheese. Cover and keep warm over a low heat.                                                                            To make the shrimp: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring, until the mixture is dark and golden, about 5 minutes. Add the bell peppers, onions, jalapeos, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and pepper. Cook until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.                                                                            Slowly whisk in the cream. Once the cream is fully incorporated, slowly whisk in the tomatoes and 2/3 cup of water. Stir in the shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are just opaque, about 5 minutes.                                                                            Season the shrimp with the remaining 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and Tabasco. Serve the shrimp over the grits and garnish with the Parmesan cheese and parsley.
