Bring to a boil.  Take the pot off the heat, then add the salt, sugar, and flour all at once, and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the flour is absorbed into the butter-water mixture.  Lower the heat to medium-low, and return the pan to the heat, stirring the dough continuously for about 30-60 seconds, until the dough comes away from the sides of the pot.                                                                                                                              6                                                                            Scoop the dough out of the pot and into a large mixing bowl.  Let stand and cool for about 3 minutes.  Then add one egg at a time, and use a hand mixer to incorporate the eggs into the dough.  At the very end, add in 3 ounces of Gruyère and 1 once of Parmesan.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Use an ice cream scoop to mound the gougères onto a parchment-lined baking or cookie sheet.  You should end up with 8-10 gougères, depending on your scoop.  Then top with the remaining Gruyère and Parmesan, and sprinkle with just a touch of coarse cracked black pepper.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Bake the gougères at 400°F for 10 minutes.
