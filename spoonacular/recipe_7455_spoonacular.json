Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Menage a Trois Limelight Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 11 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":492092,"title":"Menage a Trois Limelight Pinot Grigio","description":"Ménage à Trois Limelight shines a spotlight on refreshing citrus flavors in the most dazzling way.

Place in a shallow dish.In a small bowl, stir together the chopped rosemary, chopped thyme and garlic paste. Rub the herb-garlic paste all over the outside and inside of the fish. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the vermouth and olive oil over the fish, turn to coat and let stand for 30 minutes.Prepare a grill for direct grilling over medium-high heat. Brush and oil the grill grate and a fish-grilling basket, if desired.Remove the fish from the marinade; discard the marinade. Stuff the fish cavities with a few of the lemon slices and the rosemary and thyme sprigs.Arrange the fish on the grill or in the basket directly over medium-high heat. Grill, turning once, until nicely charred and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. During the last few minutes of grilling, grill the remaining lemon slices over the hottest part of the fire, turning once, until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side.Transfer the fish to individual plates or a serving platter, garnish with the grilled lemon slices and serve immediately.
