Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Mark West Pinot Grigio with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":490366,"title":"Mark West Pinot Grigio","description":"Crisp and clean, this wine features honeydew, stone fruit, and citrus with a subtle, clean, lingering finish.\nTry pairing with good old fish and chips, summer salads, and steamed clams by the dozen...or dozens.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/490366-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9,"ratingCount":7.0,"score":0.8545454545454546,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fmark-west-pinot-grigio-2017%2F510897"}]},"instructions":"1. Put a heatproof serving platter on a rack in the center of the oven and heat oven to 200 degrees. (This is optional, but will help keep the fish warm as you cook it in batches.)2. In a medium bowl, combine the beans, tomatillos, mango, red onion, lime juice, 1/3 cup of the vegetable oil, cilantro and a few grinds of black pepper; toss gently. Let the salad stand at room temperature while you cook the fish.3. Mix 1/4 teaspoon black pepper with the chili powder, cumin, oregano, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Rub both sides of the tilapia fillets with the mixture.4. In a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet, heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat until hot. Cook two of the tilapia fillets until lightly browned and the flesh is opaque and cooked though, about 2 minutes on each side. Transfer the fish to the platter in the oven to keep warm while you cook the remaining two fillets. Transfer the fillets to the platter and spoon half of the salsa on top. Serve with the remaining salsa on the side.*Note: Puree a little little bit of the salsa with or with out the fish for puree eating babies. You can also spoon pureed salsa over little flakes of fishand a steamed grain, if you have itfor children eating textured foods.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Put a heatproof serving platter on a rack in the center of the oven and heat oven to 200 degrees.
