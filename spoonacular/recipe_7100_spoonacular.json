Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Ziobaffan Organic Pinot Grigio. It has 4.6 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":436738,"title":"Ziobaffa Organic Pinot Grigio","description":"Ziobaffa Organic Pinot Grigio has fresh rich aromas of apples and pears with hints of citrus that fade into a floral bouquet and on the palate it is bright and fresh with wonderful fruit flavors.ZIOBAFFA Pinot Grigio pairs well with a wide array of lighter cuisine, especially fish/shellfish, poultry, pastas in cream sauce and softer cheeses.
