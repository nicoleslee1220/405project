Toss with half of the dressing and season with salt and pepper. Divide the mixture among 4 plates and arrange the beets around the plate.

Whisk together lemon juice, vinegar, mayonnaise, mustards and salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk in the oil until emulsified and stir in the tarragon.                          Combine water, salt, and sugar in a large container and mix until the salt is completely dissolved. Add the fish, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour.                          Soak wood chips in water for at least 1 hour. Remove trout, rinse and dry thoroughly.                          Use a covered grill (charcoal, gas or electric) and preheat to about 200 degrees F. Cover                          heated coals with 1/3 of the hickory chips. Place fish, skin side down, on well-greased grill, about 4 inches from coals. Close grill hood and open vent to circulate smoke. Add additional hickory chips, as necessary. Smoke trout for approximately 20 minutes.
