Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. One wine you could try is Matanzas Creek Alexander Valley Merlot. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 28 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":483162,"title":"Matanzas Creek Alexander Valley Merlot","description":"A medium purple color.

Saute the olive oil, onions, and ginger in a large saute pan over medium-low heat for 10 minutes, or until the onions are translucent. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute. Add the mangos, reduce the heat to low and cook for 10 more minutes. Add the orange juice, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, and jalapeno; cook for 10 more minutes, until orange juice is reduced, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and add the mint. Serve warm, at room temperature, or chilled.                          Heat a saute pan over high heat for 5 minutes until very hot. Season the tuna liberally with salt and pepper.

Sear for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until the outside is browned, but the inside is very rare.
