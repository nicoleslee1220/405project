Place over medium heat and heat, stirring, just long enough to dissolve the sugar, then pour over the beets, immersing them fully and filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Using a hot, damp towel, wipe the rims clean. Seal tightly with lids and screw bands. Process the jars in a hot-water bath for 15 minutes.
