Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Anne Amie Pinot Gris with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":447981,"title":"Anne Amie Pinot Gris","description":"Aromas of Bartlett pear, gardenia, white peach, white tea, jasmine, graham cracker, and straw.

Do not rinse.Position a rack in the upper third of an oven and a rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat to 450F.In a Dutch oven or deep fryer over high heat, pour in oil to a depth of 3 inches and heat to 365F on a deep-frying thermometer. Add the potatoes in batches and fry until they begin to turn golden, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Turn off the heat under the oil. In a baking pan, spread the potatoes in a single layer. Bake on the top rack of the oven until crisp, about 5 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 200F.Meanwhile, pat the fish fillets dry and season with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, whisk the egg white until soft peaks form and fold into the batter. Over high heat, return the oil to 365F. Dip 2 fillets into the batter, allowing the excess to drip off. Lower them into the oil. Fry, turning occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer the fish to an ovenproof platter and place on the lower oven rack. Repeat with the remaining fish.In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, garlic and mustard. Remove the potatoes and fish from the oven. Sprinkle the potatoes with salt and pile them on the platter with the fish. Garnish with lemon wedges and parsley sprigs.
