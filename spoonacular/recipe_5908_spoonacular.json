Once reduced, remove from heat and let cool. Once cool, add Red Hot Sauce and stir to combine.In a large saucepan, over medium heat, bring chicken stock to a gentle boil. Stir in grits. Cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. (The grits will stick to the bottom of the pan a bit, so dont panic.) Lower the heat to medium low and add whole milk and half & half to grit mixture and stir to combine. Cook for an additional 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the pan from heat and set aside.In a large skillet, add 2 tablespoons of canola oil until it shimmers. Add the sliced sausage and stir frequently to brown edges, then add sliced mushrooms. (The mushrooms will release a lot of their moisture.) Cook sausage and mushrooms until liquid is almost gone. Add chopped tomatoes and green onions. Sprinkle with a pinch of kosher salt to help remove liquid from tomatoes and green onions and stir to combine. Add shrimp and cook for 3-4 minutes and stir. Next pour in the Worcesteshire/Red Hot sauce. Stir to thoroughly incorporate sauce into the ingredients and cook for another 3-4 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and stir in chopped parsley.Serve shrimp and sausage mixture over grits. Top grits with shredded monterey jack cheese if desired.**The grits, by themselves, make for a warm and filling breakfast (which is how they are traditionally served). But never ever put sugar or pour syrup on them. The great spirits of the South will find you and torment you for desecrating the sanctity of the grits.
