Cut peeled celery into 2-inch lengths, then use slicer to julienne enough celery to measure 2 cups, reserving all trimmings. Transfer julienned celery to a bowl and chill.                                                                Cut enough of trimmings and remaining ribs into 1/4-inch slices to measure 2 cups. Add celery slices (not julienne) and water to a small saucepan and simmer, covered, until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add parsley, stirring until wilted.

Heat 1 cup oil in a 10-inch skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then fry bread, stirring constantly, until golden brown, 15 to 20 seconds. Immediately transfer croutons with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, then sprinkle with celery salt. Cool croutons to room temperature.
