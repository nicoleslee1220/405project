Place the potato inside to bake for 1 hour.                          Though these shrimp are served in the shell, run a small, sharp knife down the length of the shrimp to devein them. In a large saucepan, combine the water, lemon, parsley, peppercorns, bay leaves, salt, and hot sauce. Stir to blend and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat and allow the liquid to cool for a few minutes. Add the shrimp and allow them to sit in the liquid, off the heat, until they are cooked in the middle, 3 to 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the shrimp and drain them on a kitchen towel. Refrigerate until ready to serve.                          When the potato is tender (check by piercing with the tip of a knife), shut the oven off, remove the potato, and place it on a flat surface. Sprinkle the curry powder in a thin layer in an oven proof skillet and toast it in the oven (with the door open) until you smell the aroma of the curry, 2 minutes. Remove and set aside to cool. Split the potato in half lengthwise and scoop out the flesh. Transfer the flesh to a blender and add the warm water, egg yolks, mustard, and lemon juice. Pulse to blend. Add the curry powder and a splash of vinegar, if desired. With the blender running, pour a steady stream of the olive oil through the top, start with 1/2 cup and then taste. If needed, add more olive oil. Serve the sauce in a bowl on the side with the shrimp.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":450.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the potato inside to bake for 1 hour.","ingredients":[{"id":11352,"name":"potato","localizedName":"potato","image":"potatoes-yukon-gold.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}],"length":{"number":60,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Though these shrimp are served in the shell, run a small, sharp knife down the length of the shrimp to devein them.
