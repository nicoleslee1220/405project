To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. One wine you could try is Foley Johnson Carneros Chardonnay. It has 4.6 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 23 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":438603,"title":"Foley Johnson Carneros Chardonnay","description":"Our 2014 Carneros Chardonnay has a beautiful golden color.
