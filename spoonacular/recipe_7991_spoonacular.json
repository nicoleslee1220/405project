Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. The Flora Springs Napa Valley Merlot with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":457827,"title":"Flora Springs Napa Valley Merlot","description":"Bursting with big black cherry, juniper berry and black licorice flavors, easing into notes of cardamom, cinnamon, and gentle vanilla creme.

Drain your tuna well - particularly if you're bad like me and can't stop buying the Italian, oil packed variety which is the most delicious - and dump it in a bowl. Add 2 Tbsp of the dressing to the tuna and mash it up with a fork and mix well.Toss the sliced cucumber in the remaining Tbsp of dressing and give it a stir.Cut the loaf of bread horizontally and use your fingers to pinch out a good bit of the soft bread inside. You're making a little nest for your sandwich ingredients and allowing the sandwich to flatten out a bit. You want to pinch out about a cup's worth of bread. Spread a thin layer of tapenade on piece of bread. Place a layer of basil leaves, followed by a layer of sliced egg. Now use a spoon to mound the tuna next. Follow with a layer of sliced cucumber. Place the top of the bread and press down gentlyWrap the whole sandwich in plastic. Put it on a plate and weigh it down with something. Put the whole works in the fridge for at least an hour or over night. You want the flavours to blend but also for the sandwich to compact so it's easier to slice. For adults you could cut it into quarters, for kids I split them in half again.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Whisk together oil, vinegar and mustard until you have a smooth dressing.","ingredients":[{"id":2046,"name":"mustard","localizedName":"mustard","image":"regular-mustard.jpg"},{"id":2053,"name":"vinegar","localizedName":"vinegar","image":"vinegar-(white).jpg"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","localizedName":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Drain your tuna well - particularly if you're bad like me and can't stop buying the Italian, oil packed variety which is the most delicious - and dump it in a bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":10015121,"name":"tuna","localizedName":"tuna","image":"canned-tuna.png"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add 2 Tbsp of the dressing to the tuna and mash it up with a fork and mix well.Toss the sliced cucumber in the remaining Tbsp of dressing and give it a stir.","ingredients":[{"id":11206,"name":"cucumber","localizedName":"cucumber","image":"cucumber.jpg"},{"id":10015121,"name":"tuna","localizedName":"tuna","image":"canned-tuna.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Cut the loaf of bread horizontally and use your fingers to pinch out a good bit of the soft bread inside.
