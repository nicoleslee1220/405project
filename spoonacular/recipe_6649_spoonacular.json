Add thinly sliced onion, pomelo juice, lime juice and lemon juice, making sure the fish is completely submerged in citrus juice.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least six hours (opaque except for the very center) or overnight (completely opaque) depending on your preference.  When fish is cooked to your liking, carefully drain out all but a quarter cup or so of the citrus juice (in other words all the juice that is easily drained without dropping any fish in the sink).                                     Add toasted, crushed coriander seeds and sriracha to fish, stirring to combine.  At this point, I was still many hours away from serving this dish so I re-covered the bowl with plastic wrap and returned it to the refrigerator to allow the flavors to develop.                                  When you are ready to serve, carefully fold in the slivered cherry tomatoes, carrot ribbons, salt, sugar and pomelo flesh.  If using grapefruit, add more sugar to taste (in my experience, pomelo is a bit sweeter than grapefruit).  Pour coconut cream over the mixture and stir to combine.  Transfer Poisson Cru to serving bowl.  You can place the serving bowl in a larger bowl filled with ice water to ensure it is chilled when eaten.
