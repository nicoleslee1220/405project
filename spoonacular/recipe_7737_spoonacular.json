Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. The Rabble Merlot with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Lay the tuna on the rosemary sprigs and cook until the cooked white of the flesh has traveled about one-third of the way up the side of the tuna steak, about 5 minutes. Turn the tuna over and cook until cooked but still quite pink inside, another 5 minutes. (The tuna will continue to cook as it cools.) Remove the tuna from the pan and allow it to cool (pull off any clinging herbs).    In a food processor, combine the cooled tuna, the butter, lemon juice, salt, and pepper and process until smooth. Put the spread into a ramekin or small bowl, lightly cover the top with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until set. Grind more pepper over the top before serving with crostini or crackers.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Size                        :                      based on eight servings, Calories                        (kcal):                      190, Fat                        (kcal):                      19, Fat Calories                        (g):                      170, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      11, Protein                        (g):                      6, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      6, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      0, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      1, Sodium                        (g):                      85, Cholesterol                        (g):                      60, Fiber                        (g):                      0,                     Photo: Martha Holmberg & Steve Hunter          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Arrange the rosemary in an even layer in a nonstick skillet, add the oil, and heat over medium until the herbs are fragrant.","ingredients":[{"id":2036,"name":"rosemary","localizedName":"rosemary","image":"rosemary.jpg"},{"id":1002044,"name":"herbs","localizedName":"herbs","image":"mixed-fresh-herbs.jpg"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Lay the tuna on the rosemary sprigs and cook until the cooked white of the flesh has traveled about one-third of the way up the side of the tuna steak, about 5 minutes.
