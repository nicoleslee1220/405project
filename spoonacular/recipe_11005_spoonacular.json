Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.                          In a large bowl, combine all the vegetables, coat with olive oil and season generously with salt.                          Spread the vegetables on a sheet tray in an even layer, don't pile them up. The vegetables don't need to be spread out but they need to be pretty much in a single even layer. If this is not the case, use 2 trays.                          Put the vegetables in the preheated oven. 15 minutes into the cooking process, stir the vegetables so they have the chance to brown all over, and rotate the tray to insure even cooking. Repeat this process after another 15 minutes. Roast the vegetables for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are roasty brown and should smell almost like popcorn!. Check for doneness. This means taste some! If they aren't very roasty brown, let them go for another few minutes until they are. Season with salt, if needed. Transfer to a serving dish, garnish with chives and serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":375.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":3,"step":"In a large bowl, combine all the vegetables, coat with olive oil and season generously with salt.","ingredients":[{"id":11583,"name":"vegetable","localizedName":"vegetable","image":"mixed-vegetables.png"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Spread the vegetables on a sheet tray in an even layer, don't pile them up.
