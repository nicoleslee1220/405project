Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. The Miranda Lambert County Road Merlot Wine with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.
