[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"What the heck is Amaranth? Ya, I had no idea either a few weeks ago. I was at Whole Foods in the bulk section and was looking for the Farro, which is another amazing grain. I asked the very knowledgeable young lady if she had any other \"favorite\" grains and she turned me on to Amaranth. She was right! Amaranth is a grain originating from the Aztecs...a looong time ago. It is boiled with water or broth to make an almost, grits-like consistency. It has a nutty sweetness to it that makes it even great in the morning as a hot cereal with nuts and fruit! This recipe is a more savory recipe with a touch of butter and parmesan cheese. I served it as a bed to sauteed kale and grilled squid. The amaranth was my favorite part of the dish!P.S. This is a great gluten-free option and is LOADED with protein - nearly 14 grams per serving!Ingredients:-1 cup amaranth grains (not flour)-2.5 cups water or broth (veggie or chicken)-1 Tbsp butter, optional-1/8 cup shredded Parmesan cheese","ingredients":[{"id":1033,"name":"parmesan","localizedName":"parmesan","image":"parmesan.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"hot cereal","localizedName":"hot cereal","image":""},{"id":20001,"name":"amaranth","localizedName":"amaranth","image":"amaranth.jpg"},{"id":5006,"name":"whole chicken","localizedName":"whole chicken","image":"whole-chicken.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","localizedName":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"grains","localizedName":"grains","image":""},{"id":1006615,"name":"broth","localizedName":"broth","image":"chicken-broth.png"},{"id":10020005,"name":"farro","localizedName":"farro","image":"farro-or-spelt.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","localizedName":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":9431,"name":"fruit","localizedName":"fruit","image":"mixed-fresh-fruit.jpg"},{"id":8160,"name":"grits","localizedName":"grits","image":"cornmeal.png"},{"id":15175,"name":"squid","localizedName":"squid","image":"calamari-or-squid.jpg"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":11233,"name":"kale","localizedName":"kale","image":"kale.jpg"},{"id":12135,"name":"nuts","localizedName":"nuts","image":"nuts-mixed.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"In a medium saucepan, add your 1 cup amaranth and 2.5 cups of water with some salt or broth. I used my homemade vegetable stock made from old scraps! Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 25 minutes or until the water is absorbed. It will be a consistency of grits or hot cereal.Once the amaranth is done cooking stir in the 1 Tbsp butter (you can use less or none at all) and 1/8 cup shredded Parmesan. Again you can use more or less of the cheese as well. Stir until blended and serve warm as a side dish with fish, chicken or meat. It makes for a very prettypresentationas a \"bed\" to your main dish. If you're stuck on boring pasta or rice, try this much lower carb, protein-packed and gluten-free grain as an alternative.
