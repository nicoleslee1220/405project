The nose immediately releases tones of honeysuckle and strawberry jam, finishing with a herbal tone of rosemary and cypress. On the palate, the power of this wine impresses. There is an explosion of flavors, all framed tightly by firm bright acids. Flavors are dominated by tart cranberries and raspberries, giving way to the ever-elusive lush blueberry tones. The finish is dominated by vanilla bean with lingering black pepper and orange peel. This is an exciting year for Sangiovese and has the potential to age 15–20 years.","price":"$49.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/493538-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":9.0,"score":0.8242857142857143,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Ftenuta-di-arceno-strada-al-sasso-chianti-classico-gran-selezione-2016%2F581329"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"originalId":null}
