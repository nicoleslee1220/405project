Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Thrive Pinot Grigio.

Pat them dry and refrigerate, uncovered, for about an hour before cooking.                                  Cut an x in the bottom end of each tomato.  Briefly blanch the tomatoes in boiling, salted water and shock them in an ice bath.  When cool enough to handle, core, peel, and seed them, then cut them into chunks.                                  Place the tomatoes in a blender, add the shallot and garlic, and puree until smooth.                                  Heat the olive oil in a small, shallow pan over medium-low heat.  Add the saffron, crumbling it with your fingers, and toast in the oil until fragrant.  Remove from heat and carefully pour it into the tomato puree.  Whiz the mixture in the blender again to incorporate, then pour the mixture out into the pan.  Warm over medium heat until slightly reduced.                                  Season the swordfish steaks with salt on both sides.  Add a thin film of grapeseed oil to the bottom of a skillet and warm over medium-high heat until shimmering.  Add the swordfish steaks two at a time and saut until browned and just cooked through, about 3-5 minutes per side, depending on thickness.                                  Stir the sherry vinegar into the coulis, season with salt to taste, and divide the sauce among four plates.  Place the seared swordfish steaks on top, and finish with a sprinkle of chopped fresh parsley.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Trim the swordfish steaks to remove any bloodlines.
