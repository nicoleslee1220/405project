[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the salad, combine pomegranate, oranges, grapes, lime zest, lime juice, and mint leaves. Set aside briefly. In a small bowl, make a paste with the 1/2 cup of the lemon juice (reserving the rest - about 1/4 cup - for a lemon-butter sauce), lemon zest, and lemon pepper. Season the swordfish steaks with salt and press some of the lemon paste into the top surface of the fish to make a crust on each.  Over medium heat in a large saute pan, heat the olive oil and melt 1/4 cup butter. Starting with the crust side down first, sear the swordfish steaks. It is important to leave the fish undisturbed for about 3 minutes for the seasonings to integrate into the surface of the fish and for the caramelization process to begin. This will prevent the layer of seasonings from \"crusting off\". Flip the fish and sear the other side. Swordfish must be cooked briefly because it easily dries out.","ingredients":[{"id":15110,"name":"swordfish steaks","localizedName":"swordfish steaks","image":"swordfish.jpg"},{"id":1012030,"name":"lemon pepper","localizedName":"lemon pepper","image":"seasoning.png"},{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","localizedName":"lemon juice","image":"lemon-juice.jpg"},{"id":2064,"name":"mint","localizedName":"mint","image":"mint.jpg"},{"id":1009286,"name":"pomegranate","localizedName":"pomegranate","image":"pomegranate.jpg"},{"id":9156,"name":"lemon zest","localizedName":"lemon zest","image":"zest-lemon.jpg"},{"id":9160,"name":"lime juice","localizedName":"lime juice","image":"lime-juice.png"},{"id":1042027,"name":"seasoning","localizedName":"seasoning","image":"seasoning.png"},{"id":1009159,"name":"lime zest","localizedName":"lime zest","image":"zest-lime.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":15110,"name":"swordfish","localizedName":"swordfish","image":"swordfish.jpg"},{"id":9200,"name":"orange","localizedName":"orange","image":"orange.png"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","localizedName":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":9132,"name":"grapes","localizedName":"grapes","image":"red-grapes.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"crust","localizedName":"crust","image":""},{"id":9150,"name":"lemon","localizedName":"lemon","image":"lemon.png"},{"id":0,"name":"sauce","localizedName":"sauce","image":""},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Remove fish to a utility platter and let rest.
