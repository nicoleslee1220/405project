[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In the heat of the summer, I'm always looking for culinary ways to cool off. I make raw vegetable salads, cold soups, and lighter meals. Even the Adorable Monster was feeling the heat. When our neighbors invited us over to their pool, I brought him with me and took him for his second ever swim. You wouldn't think it by looking at him, but he's quite the swimmer! In between trying to swipe grilled steak and chicken off unattended plates, he had a blast paddling around the pool. And afterward, he was even curlier than usual. A regular poof ball of fur. So two weeks ago, with temperatures soaring into the mid-90's, I picked up some gorgeous, deep red Ahi Tuna from Whole Foods. One of the things I love most about Ahi Tuna is that it only needs to be seared, not cooked all the way through, which makes it taste fresh and clean. After some serious foodie meditation, I settled on making a cilantro yogurt sauce with fresh organic cilantro and plain Greek yogurt. I theorized that the sauce would give the dish an herbaceous, refreshing component.Boy, was I right! It was so tasty I wanted to eat it with a spoon. Seriously, cilantro flavored yogurt anyone?To finish the dish, I whipped up a Sweet Corn Hash with Vidalia onions and organic zucchini in my cast iron skillet. The combination of the cilantro-yogurt sauce and the sweet corn hash was so delectable that I ate the leftovers with a fried egg substituting for the tuna the next morning. It was almost better, if that's possible. So stay cool this summer with this recipe!Seared Tuna with Cilantro Yogurt Sauce and Sweet Corn Hash","ingredients":[{"id":1001256,"name":"plain greek yogurt","localizedName":"plain greek yogurt","image":"white-cream.png"},{"id":11294,"name":"vidalia onion","localizedName":"vidalia onion","image":"sweet-onion.png"},{"id":10111168,"name":"sweet corn","localizedName":"sweet corn","image":"corn.png"},{"id":11583,"name":"vegetable","localizedName":"vegetable","image":"mixed-vegetables.png"},{"id":10115117,"name":"ahi tuna","localizedName":"ahi tuna","image":"tuna-steak.png"},{"id":11165,"name":"cilantro","localizedName":"cilantro","image":"cilantro.png"},{"id":11477,"name":"zucchini","localizedName":"zucchini","image":"zucchini.jpg"},{"id":5006,"name":"whole chicken","localizedName":"whole chicken","image":"whole-chicken.jpg"},{"id":1116,"name":"yogurt","localizedName":"yogurt","image":"plain-yogurt.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"sauce","localizedName":"sauce","image":""},{"id":23232,"name":"steak","localizedName":"steak","image":"ribeye-raw.jpg"},{"id":11390,"name":"hash browns","localizedName":"hash browns","image":"hash-brown-potatoes.png"},{"id":10015121,"name":"tuna","localizedName":"tuna","image":"canned-tuna.png"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","localizedName":"egg","image":"egg.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Cooking time: 30 minutes","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Serves 4 people","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Print Recipe Ingredients4 four ounce pieces of Ahi Tuna 2 tablespoons grapeseed oilsalt and peppercilantro yogurt sauce1/4 cup fresh cilantro1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt1/2 teaspoon ground cuminpinch of cayenne pepper juice of 1 lemon1 tablespoon olive oilsalt and peppersweet corn hash2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 4 ears of corn, kernels removed2 cups zucchini, chopped1 Vidalia onion or other sweet onion, peeled and chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and choppedsalt and pepper","ingredients":[{"id":1034053,"name":"extra virgin olive oil","localizedName":"extra virgin olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":2031,"name":"cayenne pepper","localizedName":"cayenne pepper","image":"chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":11294,"name":"vidalia onion","localizedName":"vidalia onion","image":"sweet-onion.png"},{"id":11167,"name":"corn on the cob","localizedName":"corn on the cob","image":"corn-on-the-cob.jpg"},{"id":10211215,"name":"whole garlic cloves","localizedName":"whole garlic cloves","image":"garlic.jpg"},{"id":11294,"name":"sweet onion","localizedName":"sweet onion","image":"sweet-onion.png"},{"id":10115117,"name":"ahi tuna","localizedName":"ahi tuna","image":"tuna-steak.png"},{"id":11477,"name":"zucchini","localizedName":"zucchini","image":"zucchini.jpg"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","localizedName":"pepper","image":"pepper.jpg"},{"id":1116,"name":"yogurt","localizedName":"yogurt","image":"plain-yogurt.jpg"},{"id":1019016,"name":"juice","localizedName":"juice","image":"apple-juice.jpg"},{"id":9195,"name":"olives","localizedName":"olives","image":"olives-mixed.jpg"},{"id":11168,"name":"corn","localizedName":"corn","image":"corn.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"To make the sweet corn hash, heat the olive oil in a cast iron skillet or saute pan.","ingredients":[{"id":10111168,"name":"sweet corn","localizedName":"sweet corn","image":"corn.png"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":11390,"name":"hash browns","localizedName":"hash browns","image":"hash-brown-potatoes.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":6,"step":"Add the onions and cook until beginning to soften (about 5 minutes).","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","localizedName":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":7,"step":"Add the garlic and saute for one more minute.

I picked up the bottle while visiting the winery in Napa with The Wine Lover (my father). We decanted the wine first to allow it to open up. Heck, it had been in a bottle for more than fifteen years. The first whiff I took held great promise - musky, earthy, some latent fruit percolating up through my nostrils. It smelled just how aged cab should. The wine drank beautifully all night long, full of musk and blackberry fruit. It was a fabulous accompaniment to a softer meal, lovely but not overpowering. A great effort from a legendary producer.
