Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is GIFFT by Kathie Lee Gifford Pinot Grigio. It has 4.8 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 15 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":482242,"title":"GIFFT by Kathie Lee Gifford Pinot Grigio","description":"GIFFT Pinot Grigio bursts with lively pear and tropical fruits, balanced by crisp acidity and an elegantly refined freshness.

Leave the thin sides long, then cut the thicker sides in half on a diagonal so they appear longer.Set up three large shallow bowls in an assembly line. Put the flour in the first bowl; the beaten eggs in the second; and the panko in the third.Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Dredge the fish fingers in the flour mixture, shaking excess into the bowl so just a light coating remains; dip in the eggs and turn to coat evenly; then dredge in the panko, turning several times to coat evenly.  (This can be a messy job...it's best to use one hand for the flour and eggs and the other for the panko.) Set the breaded tilapia fingers on the prepared baking sheet and season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to cook (this can be done several hours ahead of time).Line a plate with 3 paper towels and set by the stove. Coat a large non-stick saut pan generously with olive oil and place over medium heat. When the pan is hot, place the first batch of tilapia fingers in the pan (do not crowd) and cook until the first side is golden brown, 2-3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until done, about 2 minutes more. Transfer the fish fingers to the plate with paper towels and let sit for a minute to drain any excess oil. Remove any brown bits out of the pan, add more oil if necessary and continue to cook the fish in batches until done. Season the cooked tilapia fingers with more salt if desired. Serve with lemon wedges and Lemon-Garlic Mayonnaise.Mix the mayonnaise, garlic and lemon juice in a small bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste.Note: If you want to freeze the breaded tilapia fingers, lay them in a single layer and wrap well with aluminum foil. Place in a freezer bag in the freezer.  When you're ready to make them, simply defrost them enough so they'll lay flat in the pan and cook as directed above.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut the tilapia into \"fingers\" by first cutting the fillets in half.
