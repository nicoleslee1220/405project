Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is St. Michael-Eppan Anger Pinot Grigio. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 23 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":490914,"title":"St. Michael-Eppan Anger Pinot Grigio","description":"Depending on the soil and microclimate, Pinot gris varies from a simple everyday wine all the way up to absolute top growths. The warm, sun-exposed vineyards of the Anger sites, with their loamy limestone gravel soils, are a textbook example. The Anger Alto Adige Pinot Grigio has a noble structure, nice balance and fine acidity – making it an absolute pleasure to drink. The strong white goes well with fish and fish soup, guinea fowl breast or veal fillet.","price":"$22.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/490914-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":22.0,"score":0.8450746268656716,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fst-michael-eppan-anger-pinot-grigio-2018%2F535614"}]},"instructions":"Soak the tamarind in the hot water until soft, about 15 minutes. Put the tamarind pulp in a fine sieve set over the bowl of soaking liquid and press hard to extract as much of the pulp as possible. Stir in the garlic, ginger, shallots, chiles, and sugar and set aside.    Lightly salt the fish inside and out. Make 4 diagonal cuts about 1/2-inch deep on both sides of the fish. Put the fish in a large dish, pour the marinade over it, cover, and refrigerate. Marinate overnight (or 30 minutes, if youre going to bake the fish in the sauce), turning the fish occasionally to ensure even marinating.    Heat the oven to 375F. If youve marinated the fish overnight, transfer it to a baking dish and reserve the marinade. Scatter the tomatoes over and around the fish and bake for about 40 minutes, or until the flesh feels firm and looks opaque with no signs of pink. (If you have only let the fish marinate for 30 minutes, put the fish, marinade, and tomatoes into the baking dish. Bake until done, about 45 minutes.)    While the fish is baking, put the reserved marinade in a heavy, medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Remove from the heat and keep warm. When the fish is cooked, drain off any juices that have collected in the baking dish and add them to the sauce. Transfer the cooked fish to a heated serving platter and coat the fish with the sauce.Garnish with the cilantro.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Calories                        (kcal):                      340, Fat                        (kcal):                      3.5, Fat Calories                        (g):                      30, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      0.5, Protein                        (g):                      35, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      1, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      43, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      1.5, Sodium                        (g):                      680, Cholesterol                        (g):                      55, Fiber                        (g):                      5,                     Photo: Scott Phillips          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Soak the tamarind in the hot water until soft, about 15 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":1019322,"name":"tamarind","localizedName":"tamarind","image":"tamarind.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":15,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Put the tamarind pulp in a fine sieve set over the bowl of soaking liquid and press hard to extract as much of the pulp as possible.
