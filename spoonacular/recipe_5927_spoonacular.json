In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk, water, milk, yogurt and oil. Stir the liquid into the flour mixture with a wooden spoon. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead briefly until smooth. Divide the dough into 4 pieces and shape each piece into an oval disk. Wrap each dough disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 4 hours or overnight.                                              In a small bowl, stir together 1 tablespoon of the crme frache, 1 tablespoon of the lime juice, 1 tablespoon of the chopped dill and the horseradish and mayonnaise. Fold in the pineapple. Refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours.                                              Set a large pizza stone in the bottom third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 500 for at least 40 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1/4 cup of crme frache with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of chopped dill and 1/2 tablespoon of the lime juice.                                              On a lightly floured work surface, roll out each piece of dough to a 9-by-7-inch oval. Set the ovals on the pizza stone and bake for about 3 1/2 minutes, or just until golden and puffed.                                              Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk the oil with the remaining 1 teaspoon of lime juice and season with salt and pepper. Add the greens and toss to coat.                                              Set a hot naan on each of 4 plates and top with the greens. Cover the naans with the pineapple, half of the dill cream and the shrimp.
