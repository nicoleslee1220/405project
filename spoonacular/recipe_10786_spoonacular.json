Chardonnay and chenin blanc are great matches for grilled or seared scallops. If your scallops are being matched with bacon or other cured meats, try a lightly chilled pinot noir.

It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 10 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":441028,"title":"Santa Ema Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Santa Ema Chardonnay Reserva is a bright golden yellow colored wine that comes from the Leyda Valley. A bouquet of ripe tropical fruits emerges, such as bananas and passion fruit along with touches of honey and vanilla.
