(If using bamboo skewers, make sure to soak them in warm water for at least 15 minutes before adding ingredients.) Lightly brush all sides of each filled skewer with some of the remaining olive oil, and then season the skewers with the remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Grill or broil the skewers 6 inches from the heat source until the fish is just cooked through and vegetables are lightly browned on the edges, about 8 minutes. Enjoy while hot, with some of the Fresh Herb Pesto Sauce drizzled over all.Cook's Note: The pesto sauce can be made up to 2 days in advance and refrigerated until ready to use. If you choose to make this ahead of time, cover the top of the sauce with a thin film of oil to keep the sauce from darkening. Return to room temperature before serving.","ingredients":[{"id":93698,"name":"pesto","localizedName":"pesto","image":"basil-pesto.png"},{"id":11583,"name":"vegetable","localizedName":"vegetable","image":"mixed-vegetables.png"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":15110,"name":"swordfish","localizedName":"swordfish","image":"swordfish.jpg"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","localizedName":"pepper","image":"pepper.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"sauce","localizedName":"sauce","image":""},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":10018364,"name":"wrap","localizedName":"wrap","image":"flour-tortilla.jpg"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404730,"name":"plastic wrap","localizedName":"plastic wrap","image":"plastic-wrap.jpg"},{"id":405914,"name":"broiler","localizedName":"broiler","image":"oven.jpg"},{"id":3065,"name":"skewers","localizedName":"skewers","image":"wooden-skewers.jpg"},{"id":404706,"name":"grill","localizedName":"grill","image":"grill.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}],"length":{"number":23,"unit":"minutes"}}]}]
