An exquisite expression of the Sangiovese grape, with substantial acidity from the low pH of the soil in this region.The aromas of this complex red wine range from cherries and plums to gladiolus flowers and earthy flint. The tannic, oak-aged flavors are bright and round, with a dry, warm, earthy finish.Best enjoyed with very flavorful dishes, such as tomato-based sauces, mushroom ravioli, beef or pork roasts, and game meats from venison to pheasant. It is also excellent with mature cheeses.Blend: 85% Sangiovese, 15% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon","price":"$26.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/436659-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.96,"ratingCount":8.0,"score":0.9199999999999999,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fsanta-margherita-chianti-classico-riserva-2013%2F167314"}]},"instructions":"Preparation                                                        Put a large heavy baking sheet (17 by 14 inches) on lowest rack of oven, then preheat oven to 500°F.                                                                Meanwhile, roll out dough on a lightly floured surface with a floured rolling pin, stretching corners with your hands to form a 16- by 13-inch rectangle. (Dough will be easier to roll out as it warms.) Transfer to a large tray lined with sheet of parchment paper. Lightly prick dough all over with a fork, then slide dough (on parchment) from tray onto hot baking sheet. Bake until top is puffed and pale golden in patches, 6 to 10 minutes.
