Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Santa Margherita Pinot Grigio with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 26 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428588,"title":"Santa Margherita Pinot Grigio","description":"A pale straw yellow.
