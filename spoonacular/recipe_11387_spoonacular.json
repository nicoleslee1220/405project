After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Nickel & Nickel Harris Vineyard Merlot with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 40 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442492,"title":"Nickel & Nickel Harris Vineyard Merlot","description":"Bright red fruits, candied blueberry, Santa Rosa plum and menthol aromas all blend together to intoxicate the nose as the 2016 Harris Vineyard Merlot wafts from the glass.
