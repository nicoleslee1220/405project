Try pairing with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir. After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Raymond R Collection Merlot with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":439335,"title":"Raymond R Collection Merlot","description":"The Merlot fills the mouth with smooth cherry, raspberry and plum flavors along with hints of earth and spice in the toasty vanilla finish.
