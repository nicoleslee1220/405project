Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr체ner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Anne Amie Pinot Gris. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 14 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":447981,"title":"Anne Amie Pinot Gris","description":"Aromas of Bartlett pear, gardenia, white peach, white tea, jasmine, graham cracker, and straw.

Spread 1 1/2 bunches of dill evenly in baking pan, reserving remainder for garnish. Simmer water, clam juice, onion, salt, peppercorns, and bay leaf in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan, uncovered, 10 minutes, then pour hot mixture over dill in pan.                                                                Arrange fish, skin sides up, in 1 layer on dill in pan and season with salt and pepper. Bake, uncovered, in middle of oven until fish is just cooked through, 10 to 20 minutes, depending on thickness of fillets. Transfer fish, skin sides up, to a platter and keep warm, loosely covered with foil.
