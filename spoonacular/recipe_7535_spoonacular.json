If they are already salty, then don't add any more saltPotatoes 2 medium, either boiled until soft or cubed and microwaved for 5 minutes mixing and then microwaving for 5 more minutes until soft and well cookedOnion 2 medium, chopped fineGinger 2 tsp, chopped fine ( I used 1 tsp ginger paste)Garlic 1 tsp, chopped fine ( I used 1 tsp garlic paste)Green Chillies 4, chopped fine( You can reduce to the original recipes 2, around here we like it very spicy)Red chilly powder 1/2 tsp (adjust according to your taste- I used 1 tsp)Turmeric powder 1/4 tspPepper powder 1 tspGaram Masala powder 1 tspChopped Curry leaves fewSalt to taste- Omit if your tuna is already saltyYou can also add some bread crumbs into the filling-I sometimes do this with left over bread crumbsFor the coating:Egg whites-2 ( I used one egg mixed with 1 tbsp of water- since this is just for binding or sticking the breadcrumbs onto the cutlet, you can also use milk instead, or even a paste made with a few tablespoons of water and some all purpose flour.Bread Crumbs- I used about 4 slices of bread ( brown bread or white bread or -doesn't matter) pulsed in my food processor until crumbly. You can also usepanko (crispy Japanese breadcrumbs) avaliable at the grocers- but why bother when you can use up left over bread- I pop the ends, crusts or stray slices of bread into a zip lock in the freezer and then lightly toast them in the toaster & pulse in the mixer/ food processor to use whenever I need breadcrumbs.Method:Heat 2 tbsp oil in a pan and saut the chopped onion, ginger, garlic, green chillies and curry leaves until the onions are golden brown.Add the masala powders except the garam masala and saut for a minute or two.Add the tuna and saut, mixing well with a spoon, until tuna turns light brown and has broken up into flaky bits.Add garam masala, and mix well. Turn off the heat and keep aside to cool for about 10 mins(You can also do this a day ahead and keep in the fridge to form the cutlets the next day )Meanwhile boil an mash the potatoes or cook them in the microwave. I cut them into cubes, sprinkle a little salt on them and microwave for about 5 mins. Then I mix them around in the bowl and microwave for afurther3-5 mins until fork tender.Once the fish mixture is cool to touch, add the cooked mashed potatoes, about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs if you like, and mix well with your hand.Form the mixture into the shape you like. (I love Swapna's heart shapes. I made rounds though ovals are the most efficient, taking less space in the pan and also in a box to store.)Beat the egg slightly with a fork adding 1 tbsp of water.Dip the cutlets in beaten egg and then roll them in breadcrumbs until coated on all sides but not over coated. You can also just dip them in milk and then coat in breadcrumbs.You can freeze them at this stage to fry later. Place them stacked in a box with a sheet of foil or a piece of plastic in between layers to make sure they don't stick to each other.To fry, pour oil into a small sauce pan so that there is atleast an inch.I used a very small saucepan- the once I use for tadkaand fried them one at a time, adding more oil as necessary so that I used less oil.When the oil starts to bubble carefully fry the cutlets until brown, flip and fry the other side.Make sure you drop the cutlets into only hot bubbly oil. If the oil is not hot enough, the cutlets will simply soak up excess oil and become soggy.If you try to cook them on a skillet with very little oil you may find that while the bottom of the cutlet browns, the sides (edges) will be uncooked and the cutlets may crack at the sides. In that case try flipping them over on their sides ( see the oval shape helps here too!) and cook the sides as well.Once brown on all sides, place them on a kitchen towel or napkin to soak up the excess oil.Remove the crumbs that fall into the oil periodically as these could burn and turn black and are known carcinogens.You could also smear the cutlets with oil, put them on a baking dish or sheet and bake them in the oven till brownThey make goodappetizers or can be served with rice. My mom also used to make sandwiches with a cutlet, a slice of onion and tomato and a smear of home made mayo.These cutlets are on their way, once again to Kerala Kitchen for this month's edition hosted by Ria of Ria's collection :)","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"If you are totally paranoid you could also smear a little oil on both sides, lay them on a baking sheet and bake until crispy.
