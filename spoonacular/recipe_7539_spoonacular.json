Try pairing with Merlot, Pinot Noir, and rosé Wine. Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. One wine you could try is Pride Mountain Vineyards Merlot. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 50 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":445499,"title":"Pride Mountain Vineyards Merlot","description":"A sumptuous nose of bright plum, cherry, rose petal, mulberry and walnut introduces an enticing wine that sets the taste buds firing.
