[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Rinse the scallops and dry well with paper towels. Season the scallops with salt and pepper. In a large, heavy fry pan over high heat, warm the olive oil until it shimmers. In batches without crowding, add the scallops and sear until nicely browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Turn the scallops over and brown the other side, about 1 minute more. Return all the scallops to the pan, add the lemon zest and thyme, and cook for a moment. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the scallops to a bowl. Reduce the heat to low and add the butter and shallots to the pan. Saut until softened, about 4 minutes.Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Generously salt the boiling water, add the pasta and cook until al dente (tender but firm to the bite), 3 to 4 minutes.While the pasta is cooking, add the lemon juice and stock to the fry pan and deglaze the pan, stirring to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom. Simmer until slightly thickened, 3 to 4 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","localizedName":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","localizedName":"lemon juice","image":"lemon-juice.jpg"},{"id":9156,"name":"lemon zest","localizedName":"lemon zest","image":"zest-lemon.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":10015172,"name":"scallops","localizedName":"scallops","image":"scallops.jpg"},{"id":11677,"name":"shallot","localizedName":"shallot","image":"shallots.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","localizedName":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","localizedName":"pasta","image":"fusilli.jpg"},{"id":1006615,"name":"stock","localizedName":"stock","image":"chicken-broth.png"},{"id":2049,"name":"thyme","localizedName":"thyme","image":"thyme.jpg"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404636,"name":"slotted spoon","localizedName":"slotted spoon","image":"slotted-spoon.jpg"},{"id":405895,"name":"paper towels","localizedName":"paper towels","image":"paper-towels.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"},{"id":404752,"name":"pot","localizedName":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}],"length":{"number":13,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Drain the pasta well and add it to the fry pan.","ingredients":[{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","localizedName":"pasta","image":"fusilli.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the scallops and any juices that have accumulated, then add the capers and pine nuts.
