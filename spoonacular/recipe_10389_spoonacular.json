Puree until blended and thick. Pour into a shallow baking dish and add the chicken. Toss to coat and marinate the chicken while finishing the dish.                          Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium heat.                          Meanwhile, heat a large skillet. Crush 3 garlic cloves and set aside. Heat 1 cup olive oil in the skillet. Add the garlic and cook until golden. Remove sausage from casings and add to the skillet. Saute the sausage until browned.                          In the boiling water, blanch the broccoli rabe until just soft but still crunchy. Transfer rabe to a bowl of ice water. Remove from water, drain on paper towel-lined plate and set aside.                          Grill the chicken until cooked through and juices run clear.                          To the browned sausage, add the mushrooms and saute until mushrooms start getting soft. Add the rabe, the chicken stock and a pinch of red pepper flakes and season with salt and pepper.                          Slice the bread and lay out on a serving plate. Spoon some of the broccoli rabe/sausage mixture over top, then cover each with 1 chicken breast and 1 thigh. Top with arugula, tomatoes and sliced provolone cheese. Then drizzle some of the broccoli rabe sauce over top, to wilt the arugula, and serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a blender, combine 1 cup olive oil, basil, red pepper flakes and 2 cloves garlic.
