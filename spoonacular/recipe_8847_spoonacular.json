Try pairing with Chardonnay, Muscadet, and Riesling. Buttery chardonnay is great for scallops, shrimp, crab, and lobster, while muscadet is a classic pick for mussels, oysters, and clams. If you've got some spice in your shellfish, a semi-dry riesling can balance out the heat. One wine you could try is Santan Ema Reserve Chardonnay. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 10 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":441028,"title":"Santa Ema Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Santa Ema Chardonnay Reserva is a bright golden yellow colored wine that comes from the Leyda Valley.
