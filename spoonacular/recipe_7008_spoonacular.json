Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Esperto Pinot Grigio with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 10 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":440803,"title":"Esperto Pinot Grigio","description":"Brilliant straw color with reflections of gold.
