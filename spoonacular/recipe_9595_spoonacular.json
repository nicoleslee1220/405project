Prepare the rice: Strain rice and transfer to a 2-qt. saucepan along with the salt, turmeric, and 2 cups water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 10 minutes. Remove pot from heat and keep covered in a warm place.3. Meanwhile, make the stew: Bring beets and 6 cups water to a boil in a 4-qt. saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until beets are tender, about 30 minutes. Remove pot from heat and, using a slotted spoon, transfer beets to a bowl; reserve beet juice.4. Put garlic on a work surface and sprinkle with a little salt; finely chop. Scrape the garlic into a paste with the side of the chef's knife. In a small bowl, combine garlic paste, 3 tbsp. oil, coriander, cumin, curry powder, turmeric, paprika, ginger, and cayenne; set spice paste aside. Heat remaining olive oil in a 6-qt. pot over medium-high heat. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 7 minutes. Add reserved spice paste and tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Stir in 1 cup of the reserved beet juice. Add remaining beet juice, lemon juice, and sugar; simmer for 5 minutes. Using a spoon, place reserved meatballs in the simmering stew. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until meatballs are cooked through, about 8 minutes. Skim surface of stew, add reserved beets, and cook for 2 more minutes. To serve, fluff rice with a fork and spoon it into serving bowls along with ladlefuls of the stew and meatballs; season and garnish with parsley.Pairing Note: The earthy 2006 Marqus de Cceres grenache ros 2006 ($9) from Rioja has refreshing spicy notes and pairs well with this earthy dish.
