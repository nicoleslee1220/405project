Put the snapper fillets in a large glass dish and rub with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours.                                               In a large bowl, toss the green and red cabbage with the red onion. In a small bowl, mix the yogurt and mayonnaise. Pour over the cabbage, season with salt and pepper and toss.

To assemble each taco, spread a dollop of avocado cream on a tortilla. Top with a piece of fish, a large spoonful of coleslaw and some cilantro leaves. Pass the lime wedges, hot sauce and remaining coleslaw at the table.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, garlic, serranos, paprika and 1 teaspoon of pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":2028,"name":"paprika","localizedName":"paprika","image":"paprika.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","localizedName":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","localizedName":"pepper","image":"pepper.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Put the snapper fillets in a large glass dish and rub with the marinade.
