Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Alsace Willm Pinot Gris Reserve with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 16 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":496346,"title":"Alsace Willm Pinot Gris Reserve","description":"An intense golden color with hints of ocher, the wine has a nose of ripe fruit, quince. In the mouth the attack is both supple and full, with notes of honey and spices.
