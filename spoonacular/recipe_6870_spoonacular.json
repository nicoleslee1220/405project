Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Maysaran Arsheen Pinot Gris with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":476600,"title":"Maysara Arsheen Pinot Gris","description":"A bright expression of fruit right up front, greeting your palate with notes of cut grass on a warm day.

Melt 4 Tbs. of the butter in a medium saucepan or skillet over medium-low heat. Lightly brush the inside of a 9x13-inch Pyrex baking dish with some of the melted butter. Transfer 1 Tbs. of the melted butter to a small dish and keep warm. Add the scallions to the remaining butter in the saucepan and cook, stirring, until softened, about 2 min.    In a medium bowl, mix the melted scallion butter with the breadcrumbs, tarragon, beaten egg, 1/4 tsp. salt, and several grinds of pepper.    Lightly season the fillets on both sides with salt and pepper. Lay a fillet on a work surface with the pointed end facing you. Mound a quarter of the stuffing on the pointed half of the fillet. Fold the wide, split end of the fillet over and press firmly (but dont squish) to cover the stuffing. Some stuffing will remain exposed. Put the stuffed fillet in the buttered baking dish. Repeat with the remaining fillets. Brush the tops of the fillets with the reserved tablespoon of melted butter. Pour the vermouth and chicken broth around, not over, the fillets.    Bake until the fish feels firm but flaky and the insides of the fillets look opaque when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife, 20 to 25 min. Using a thin, flexible slotted metal spatula, transfer the fillets to four dinner plates.    Add 1 Tbs. cold butter to the hot baking dish and whisk until the butter melts. Repeat with the remaining 1 Tbs. butter and the mustard. Season the sauce with salt and pepper and spoon over the fillets.
