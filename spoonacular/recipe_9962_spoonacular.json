The wine is\nluscious and round with gentle acidity, balanced by a hint of sweetness(9.2g/L). Lemon peel,\nmarmalade, candyfloss, coriander, ginger and floral notes can all be found on the nose. The palate is\nmouthfilling and rich with lovely concentration. Lychee, lemon and Turkish delight flavours lead on to a\nlong spicy finish.
