Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Santi Sortesele Pinot Grigio. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":481300,"title":"Santi Sortesele Pinot Grigio","description":"Straw yellow hue, accompanied by a close-focused nose of pear, apricot and white flowers.

In a shallow bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, salt, pepper, and chopped thyme. Dredge the skate pieces in the cornmeal mixture and shake off the excess    Heat the oil in a heavy skillet or frying pan over medium heat until it barely begins to smoke. Carefully add the skate to the oil in a single layer. If they won't fit in a single layer, fry them in batches. Cook for 3 to 4 min., until the crust is lightly browned. Turn and cook another 2 to 3 min.    Remove the skate from the pan and drain on paper towels. Arrange the skate on plates with the lemon wedges, a few thyme sprigs, and a sprinkle of chopped parsley.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Calories                        (kcal):                      480, Fat                        (kcal):                      24, Fat Calories                        (g):                      216, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      3, Protein                        (g):                      35, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      11, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      34, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      5, Sodium                        (g):                      830, Cholesterol                        (g):                      80, Fiber                        (g):                      2,                     Photo: Maria Robledo          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut the skate into four equal pieces and let them soak in the buttermilk for a few minutes.
