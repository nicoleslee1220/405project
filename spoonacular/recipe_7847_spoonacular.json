Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. You could try Goldschmidt Vineyard Alexander Valley Chelsea Merlot.

Season with salt and pepper to taste. Form the mixture into 6 patties (they will be quite loose), set on a plate and cover with plastic wrap. Put the burgers in the fridge for at least 15 minutes to firm up a little.                                  Meanwhile, slice the cucumber into wide ribbons using a peeler and make the wasabi ginger mayonnaise: stir together the mayonnaise, wasabi and pickled ginger. Add a little water if needed to thin the mayo. Cover and set aside.                                  Set a large, nonstick pan over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon oil. When the oil is hot, add the burgers to the pan in batches. Cook until golden brown on the bottom, about three minutes. Flip and cook for another few minutes, until just cooked through (you can stop the burgers at medium rare, but I like them closer to medium/medium-well). Keep in a warm place while you cook the rest of the burgers.                                  Toast the buns and serve the burgers on top, with a generous dollop of the wasabi mayonnaise, a handful of sprouts and a few ribbons of cucumber.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine the scallions, ginger, egg and tuna in a large bowl.
