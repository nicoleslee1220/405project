Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Ostertag Les Jardins Pinot Gris. It has 4.9 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 35 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":479900,"title":"Ostertag Les Jardins Pinot Gris","description":"Certified Biodynamic and practicing since 1998, the Domaine owns 35.5 acres of vineyards in over 88 separate plots spread over the villages of Epfig, Nothalten, Itterswiller, Ribeauvillé, and Albé.
