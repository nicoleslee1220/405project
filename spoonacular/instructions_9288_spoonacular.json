Slice beets into wedges.While the beets roast, prepare the citrus. De-pith and slice into segments (as shown in post). Set aside. Reserve the scraps of juicy flesh as you can use this to squeeze into your dressing.Blend the dressing ingredients together in a processor. I used my mini processor and it worked well. Adjust seasonings to taste, adding more sweetener, juice, or salt if desired.To assemble, add greens (I used a mix of blanched beet greens and baby romaine), followed by the beets and citrus segments, top with nuts, seeds, and/or cooked grains, and finally the dressing.","ingredients":[{"id":11086,"name":"beet greens","localizedName":"beet greens","image":"beet-leaves.jpg"},{"id":1042027,"name":"seasoning","localizedName":"seasoning","image":"seasoning.png"},{"id":0,"name":"sweetener","localizedName":"sweetener","image":""},{"id":10111251,"name":"romaine","localizedName":"romaine","image":"romaine"},{"id":0,"name":"grains","localizedName":"grains","image":""},{"id":21052,"name":"greens","localizedName":"greens","image":"mixed-greens-or-mesclun.jpg"},{"id":11080,"name":"beet","localizedName":"beet","image":"beets.jpg"},{"id":1019016,"name":"juice","localizedName":"juice","image":"apple-juice.jpg"},{"id":93818,"name":"seeds","localizedName":"seeds","image":"sunflower-seeds.jpg"},{"id":12135,"name":"nuts","localizedName":"nuts","image":"nuts-mixed.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","localizedName":"baking sheet","image":"baking-sheet.jpg"},{"id":404735,"name":"oven mitt","localizedName":"oven mitt","image":"oven-mitt.jpg"},{"id":404765,"name":"aluminum foil","localizedName":"aluminum foil","image":"aluminum-foil.png"}],"length":{"number":205,"unit":"minutes"}}]}]
