Compassionate Cooks' Tip             Reserve 1/4 cup (55 g) of the puréed beets (or purée a fourth beet) to create a red/pink frosting or ganache, using confectioners' sugar and nondairy butter such as Earth Balance. For a ganache, use the water in which you cooked the beets to thin out the topping. For frosting, fluff up using a hand mixer.
