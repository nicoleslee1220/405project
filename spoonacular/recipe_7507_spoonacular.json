Try pairing with Merlot, Pinot Noir, and rosé Wine. Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine.

Drizzle 1 tsp. olive oil into each jar.                                                                                                 Layer tuna medallions cut side down into each jar, sprinkling each layer with about 1/4 tsp. salt and a sprinkle of pepper, leaving 1 in. headspace between tuna and top of jar. Trim tuna to fit if necessary and use trimmings to fill any spaces. Slowly turn jar while moving a thin plastic knife up and down around inner edge of jar to release air bubbles.                                                                                                 Wipe clean rims of filled jars using damp paper towels. Top with lid and screw on ring just to close; do not tighten.                                                                                                 Assemble pressure canner according to manufacturer's instructions and fill with boiling water (usually 3 qts.). Add rack and set filled jars on rack. Water should come to just below rings on jar tops.                                                                                                 Close pressure cooker and set over high heat until steam starts to flow from vent pipe. Let flow 10 minutes, then adjust heat to maintain a steady, moderate flow of steam to begin the buildup of pressure. Start timing on a weighted-gauge canner when the weight begins to rock, or on a dial-gauge canner when the dial reads 11 lbs. of pressure. Tuna should cook for 100 minutes. Regulate heat as necessary to keep weight rocking steadily and evenly or the dial reading between 11 and 13 lbs.
