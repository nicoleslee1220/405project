Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine.

In a large saut pan, heat 1 Tbs. of butter over medium-high until foaming.  Stir in mushrooms and cook until mushrooms have given off all of their liquid and cooked through (10 or so minutes).  Season lightly with salt and pepper, transfer to a bowl and set aside.                                  Add another 1/2 a tablespoon of butter to the frying pan, then cook onion, shallot and celery together for about 5 minutes, until softened.  Stir in the chopped herbs and the sherry and cook for another 2 minutes.  Stir the mushrooms into this mixture, then set this aside.                                  In a saucepan, heat 3 tablespoons of butter over medium-high until foaming.  Stir in the flour to make a roux and cook for about 2 minutes.  Then whisk in the milk and chicken stock, bit by bit, to make a smooth sauce.  Cook, stirring, until just slightly thickened (another minute or two).  Then add the lemon zest and season with salt and pepper to taste.                                  Flake the tuna and combine the tuna, the white sauce, the mushroom-onion mixture, and the noodles all together.  Grease an 8 X 8-inch baking pan and transfer the casserole mixture into it.                                  In a small pan, melt the last tablespoon of butter.  Stir in the minced garlic and the panko breadcrumbs and cook, stirring, until the panko is golden brown.  Sprinkle this all over the casserole.  Put the casserole in the oven and bake until it is bubbly, about 30 minutes.  Serve!
