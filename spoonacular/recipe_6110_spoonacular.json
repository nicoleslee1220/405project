Superb smoky toasty nose, typical for this grape on limestone in Alsace (no new oak in our wines, just very long total lees contact). Some light reductive aromas that actually fit the style of dry Pinot-Gris. The palate is rich and creamy, with a velvety texture yet fully dry. It is an easy wine to drink now as there is no unnecessary weight. The finish is nice and round but fully dry. The complex limestone blend brings great acid balance and a certain weight. It should develop very nicely over the next few years.","price":"$45.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/467219-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8775000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fzind-humbrecht-calcaire-pinot-gris-2015%2F208573"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"sourceName":null,"creditsText":null,"originalId":null}
