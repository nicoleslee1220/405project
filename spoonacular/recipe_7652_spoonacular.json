Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. The GEN5 Merlot with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":473552,"title":"GEN5 Merlot","description":"#40 Wine Enthusiast Top 100 Best Buy of 2019","price":"$11.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/473552-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8175000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fgen5-merlot-2016%2F545509"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"originalId":null}
