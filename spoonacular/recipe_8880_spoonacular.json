Meanwhile, slice your red onion and let it soak in a bowl of very cold water. Now rub steak with a generous amount of sea salt. Add pepper if you like. (I prefer without.)      Heat a cast-iron skillet over a high flame until the pan is very, very hot. Throw the steak on and cook for 4 minutes; flip and cook for another 4. Remove to a plate and allow to rest for 10-12 minutes before slicing thinly.      While your steak is cooking, make your salad dressing. Whisk honey, mustard and vinegar together. Then whisk in olive oil to emulsify. Taste and add salt and pepper as desired.      When your steak is resting, drain the onion and pat dry with a paper towel. Combine in a bowl with the arugula, and toss well with the dressing.      Serve your sliced steak with a pile of salad mounded on the side, or on top.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Remove your steak from the fridge and let it come to room temperature (about 30 minutes).
