Try pairing with Albarino, ros√© Wine, and Sauvignon Blanc. These low-tannin, lower alcohol wines will complement the heat in spicy cajun dishes, instead of making your mouth burn more. The Viontan Albarino with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Prominent features of the bouquet are green apple, banana, kiwi and melon. On the palate, the wine has soft and agreeable acid, giving way to a melange of ripe fruits, peaches, apricot and kiwi. Lees maceration has created a body and structure with great personality. This aromatically-complex Albarino has a long finish with a touch of bittnerness -- a classic characteristic of the varietal. Ideal with fish and shellfish. But, as a wine with great aromatic structure and good acidity, it is also an excellent wine just to share with friends.","price":"$16.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452198-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8400000000000001,"ratingCount":12.0,"score":0.8129729729729731,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fvionta-albarino-2007%2F96177"}]},"instructions":"Cut the corn kernels from the cob but only cut into them about 2/3 of the way and set aside.Scrape the remaining 1/3 of the corn kernels off in a large bowl and set aside.Melt the butter in a pan over medium heat.Add the onion, celery and bell pepper and saute until tender, about 10-15 minutes.Add the corn, tomatoes, cream and thyme and simmer until the sauce thickens, about 10-15 minutes.Use an immersion blender to puree 1/4 of the corn mixture.Mix in the green onions, season with salt, pepper and cayenne to taste.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut the corn kernels from the cob but only cut into them about 2/3 of the way and set aside.Scrape the remaining 1/3 of the corn kernels off in a large bowl and set aside.Melt the butter in a pan over medium heat.","ingredients":[{"id":11172,"name":"corn kernels","localizedName":"corn kernels","image":"corn.png"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","localizedName":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the onion, celery and bell pepper and saute until tender, about 10-15 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":10211821,"name":"bell pepper","localizedName":"bell pepper","image":"bell-pepper-orange.png"},{"id":11143,"name":"celery","localizedName":"celery","image":"celery.jpg"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","localizedName":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":15,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add the corn, tomatoes, cream and thyme and simmer until the sauce thickens, about 10-15 minutes.Use an immersion blender to puree 1/4 of the corn mixture.","ingredients":[{"id":11529,"name":"tomato","localizedName":"tomato","image":"tomato.png"},{"id":1053,"name":"cream","localizedName":"cream","image":"fluid-cream.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"sauce","localizedName":"sauce","image":""},{"id":2049,"name":"thyme","localizedName":"thyme","image":"thyme.jpg"},{"id":11168,"name":"corn","localizedName":"corn","image":"corn.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404776,"name":"immersion blender","localizedName":"immersion blender","image":"immersion-blender.png"}],"length":{"number":15,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Mix in the green onions, season with salt, pepper and cayenne to taste.","ingredients":[{"id":11291,"name":"green onions","localizedName":"green onions","image":"spring-onions.jpg"},{"id":2031,"name":"ground cayenne pepper","localizedName":"ground cayenne pepper","image":"chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","localizedName":"pepper","image":"pepper.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]}],"originalId":null}
