Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. The Provenance Vineyards Napa Valley Merlot with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 34 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":432837,"title":"Provenance Vineyards Napa Valley Merlot","description":"Our 2006 Merlot isn't shy, with its deep, dark garnet hue and abounding aromas of rich black\ncherry, cassis and clove. Approachable, integrated tannins frame the generous dark fruit\nflavors and coat the palate with soft velvet.
