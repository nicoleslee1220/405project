Heat at medium-high. Once mixture comes to a simmer, turn heat down to medium and add flour all at once. Stir rapidly and consistently with a wooden spoon, until the dough pulls away from the sides and the bottom of the pan is clean with no dough sticking to it. The dough should be glossy and smooth. Turn off heat and continue to stir rapidly for 5 minutes, evaporating moisture fromthe dough. Immediately transfer the dough to an electric mixer with a paddle attachment. Add 1 teaspoon salt, Dijon mustard, chopped herbs and ground fennel seed. Mix on low for 1 minute. Add 3 large eggs, one at a time, beating between low and medium, waiting for each egg to be completely incorporated before adding the next one. When the dough is cohesive, place into a pastry bag with a 5/8-inch plain round tip. Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a simmer. Holding the pastry bag over the edge of the pot of water, squeeze bag and cut dough into 1-inch dumplings with a paring knife. Allow pieces to fall directly into the water. Work in batches of 15-20 pieces. When the gnocchi float to the surface, allow to poach for 2 more minutes. Then remove pieces with a slotted spoon or strainer to a well-oiled baking sheet. Taste one for desired tenderness before continuing. When all of the gnocchi are finished poaching, cool in refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Cover until ready to use.     For Roasted Pumpkin  Remove skin and seeds of a small baking type of pumpkin. Cut into 5-6-inch chunks, toss with olive oil and salt and pepper. Bake in 350 oven until just tender when pierced with a paring knife. Remove from oven and let cool. Cut cooled pumpkin into 3/4-inch cubes.  For Roasted Apple  Peel and quarter apple, removing the entire core. Put apple and apple juice in a non-reactive sauce pot. Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt and cover. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Remove the apples from the poaching liquid and cool in refrigerator. Cut the cooled apples into 3/4-inch cubes.  For Pumpkin Sauce  Steam or roast 2 cups of peeled, seeded pumpkin flesh until completely cooked and very soft. Transfer cooked pumpkin and caramelized onion to a blender and puree with salt, pepper, lemon juice and vegetable stock to taste. Add enough stock to create a thick sauce consistency.  For White Balsamic and Cider Reduction  In a non-reactive sauce pot, combine 1 cup white balsamic vinegar and 1 cup apple cider vinegar. Reduce by half over medium-high heat. Add 1 cup apple cider and reduce by half again. Turn heat down to medium and reduce the mixture to the consistency of maple syrup. Let cool.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For Parisian Gnocchi  In a non-reactive sauce pot, add water, butter and 1 teaspoon salt.","ingredients":[{"id":98853,"name":"gnocchi","localizedName":"gnocchi","image":"gnocchi-isolated.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","localizedName":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"sauce","localizedName":"sauce","image":""},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","localizedName":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat at medium-high.
