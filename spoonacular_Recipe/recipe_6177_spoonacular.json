Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Alsace Willm Pinot Gris Reserve with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 16 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":496346,"title":"Alsace Willm Pinot Gris Reserve","description":"An intense golden color with hints of ocher, the wine has a nose of ripe fruit, quince.

Spoon some oil over the fish and put it under a broiler for a few minutes to brown.Plate the veggies then use 2 forks to separate the meat from the bones running down the center of the fish. Spoon some sauce over the top and garnish with some fresh rosemary. If you went light on the salt, sprinkle some fleur de sel on top.
