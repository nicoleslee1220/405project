Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Miranda Lambert County Road Merlot Wine with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 28 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428265,"title":"Miranda Lambert County Road Merlot Wine","description":"Our most robust spirit is full of fruity flavor and powerful color yet smooth in texture and delivery.

In a medium bowl, toss the cabbage, cucumber, red pepper, and carrot together. Add just enough of the dressing to moisten the vegetables and mix well; refrigerate.                                                     Place the short ribs in a large bowl. Combine all the marinade ingredients in a small bowl and pour the mixture over the short ribs. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours.

When the fire has died down and the coals are very hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above the heat source for only 1 to 2 seconds), place the meat on the grill and sear well on one side, about 3 minutes. Turn and continue cooking to the desired doneness, about 3 minutes more for rare. Remove the meat from the grill, cover loosely with foil, and allow to rest for 5 minutes.
