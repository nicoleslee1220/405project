If you are purchasing a pre-cooked confit of duck, skip the instructions in this paragraph and follow the directions on the package of the product. In any event, you will need to shred the duck for use in this recipe. For your own confit of duck, mix the salt, pepper and garlic together and coat the duck with the seasonings rubbing into the surface of the duck. On the stovetop, heat the oil or lard in a deep roasting pan (if you will be using the oven) or in a large Dutch oven (if you will be cooking on the range). (Note: you will be poaching the duck, not frying it, so, it is important to avoid making the oil too hot.) Add the duck to the warm oil. If you are using the oven, put the duck in a preheated 200 degree F oven for about 6 to 8 hours. If you are using the stovetop, cook the duck at a simmer. In either case, the duck must be cooked until it falls away from the bone. Remove all the duck meat from the bones and reserve meat until needed.                          Cut the endive in half and remove the core. Lightly sear the cut sides of the endive in olive oil over medium heat in a nonstick pan. Sprinkle in the sugar, salt, pepper, and butter - cover and continue to cook until al dente - about 10 minutes. You want the endive to be slightly tender, but firm enough to support the duck filling. Season with salt and pepper, remove from heat, and let cool.                          Prepare the mango/berry puree by adding the mango and strawberries to a blender or food processor and blending until smooth.                          If duck is cold, heat or re-heat it, depending on whether you have made your own confit, or have purchased it prepared. Shred the duck with 2 forks.                          Fill each endive-half with duck, spoon mango berry puree on top and garnish with a raspberry. Serve slightly warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"The duck has to be prepared the day before because of the long slow cooking time.
