To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Canyon Road Chardonnay with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 10 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":444110,"title":"Canyon Road Chardonnay","description":"The palate is intense, round and soft, with aromas of melon and tropical fruit.","price":"$9.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/444110-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9199999999999999,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8574999999999999,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fcanyon-road-chardonnay-2002%2F61361"}]},"instructions":"Preparation                                                        Blend 1 garlic clove and next 7 ingredients in mini processor.
