Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like ahi tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your ahi tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. One wine you could try is Wild & Wilder The Exhibitionist Merlot. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":477482,"title":"Wild & Wilder The Exhibitionist Merlot","description":"The Exhibitionist is full of rich plum and damson fruit on the nose.
