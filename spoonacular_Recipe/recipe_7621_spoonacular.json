Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. The Pride Mountain Vineyards Merlot with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 50 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":445499,"title":"Pride Mountain Vineyards Merlot","description":"A sumptuous nose of bright plum, cherry, rose petal, mulberry and walnut introduces an enticing wine that sets the taste buds firing. The palate is layered and lush, expressing undulating waves of red fruit woven together by a rich mid-palate and vibrant acidity. 7% Cabernet Sauvignon from the volcanic Rim Rock block and the rocky Quartz Hill block were blended in to add depth and structure to the wine.

In a bowl, combine the crushed KELLOGG'S RICE KRISPIES, ground ginger, salt, and pepper, to taste. Coat the outside of the tuna steaks with the cereal mixture. Put the vegetable oil in the hot pan and swirl to coat, and then sear the tuna on all sides, until the coating just turns brown in color, about 2 minutes per side. This should cook the tuna perfectly with the inside remaining rare. Remove the pan from the heat.                          For the cucumber salad:                          Cut the ends off the cucumber, and then cut it into thirds. On a mandolin slicer with fine teeth in the blade, and using the hand guard, grate the cucumber pieces in a long motion. This will make cool cucumber noodle looking strands. Repeat with the remaining cucumber pieces. Put the rice noodles into a bowl and pour the boiling water over them until covered. Let noodles soak until soft and a little chewy. Drain and rinse in cold water. Cut the rice noodles down to about the same length as the cucumber and put them together in a bowl. Add the lime juice, cilantro, soy sauce, some pepper; and hoisin. Toss to combine.                          For the sauce:                          Whisk together the hoisin sauce, lime juice, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, and honey, to taste. Season the sauce with salt, and pepper, to taste.                          On each plate, place a swirled pile of the cucumber salad. Slice the tuna on a slight angle and lay over the salad. Spoon some of the hoisin-lime sauce over the top and dig in.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"For the tuna","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat a cast iron pan over medium-high heat for 8 minutes.
