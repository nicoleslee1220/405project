Wash the beets. In a large saucepan or stockpot fit with a steamer basket, steam the beets until a paring knife enters them easily, 30 to 45 minutes, depending on their size. Set aside until cool enough to handle but still warm.    Peel the beets; the skin will rub right off. Trim and discard the tops and tails and cut the beets into thick wedges. Transfer the beets to a large serving bowl and drizzle with the olive oil and vinegar. Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Sprinkle the goat cheese, oregano, and pecans over the beets and serve.    Make Ahead Tips    You can cook, peel, and cut the beets up to 6 hours ahead. Refrigerate, and return to room temperature before finishing.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Calories                        (kcal):                      140, Fat                        (kcal):                      11, Fat Calories                        (g):                      100, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      3, Protein                        (g):                      4, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      6, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      7, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      1.5, Sodium                        (g):                      110, Cholesterol                        (g):                      5, Fiber                        (g):                      1,                     Photo: Scott Phillips          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"If the beets have leaves and stems, trim off the leaves and all but 1/4 inch of the stems.
