Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Thrive Pinot Grigio with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 15 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":488256,"title":"Thrive Pinot Grigio","description":"","price":"$14.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/488256-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9,"ratingCount":10.0,"score":0.867741935483871,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fthrive-pinot-grigio-2018%2F522678"}]},"instructions":"Watch how to make this recipe.                    To make the salsa: Stir the tomatoes, onion, and cilantro together in a small bowl. Stir in the lime juice, olive oil and chile. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Place in the refrigerator to chill while preparing the fish.                          Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F.                          Pour enough canola oil into a large frying pan to generously coat the bottom. Heat over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking.                          While the oil is heating, season as many of the fillets as will fit in the pan comfortably with salt and pepper. Dredge the seasoned fillets in flour to coat both sides and shake off the excess flour. Carefully slip the coated snapper into the hot oil and give the pan a little shake to prevent sticking. Cook until lightly golden on the underside side, about 3 minutes. Flip the fillets over and cook until the thickest part of the fillets are opaque at the center, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with the remaining fillets, adding more oil to the pan, if necessary.                          Serve warm, passing the tomato salsa separately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"To make the salsa: Stir the tomatoes, onion, and cilantro together in a small bowl.
