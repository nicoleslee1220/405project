Superb smoky toasty nose, typical for this grape on limestone in Alsace (no new oak in our wines, just very long total lees contact). Some light reductive aromas that actually fit the style of dry Pinot-Gris. The palate is rich and creamy, with a velvety texture yet fully dry. It is an easy wine to drink now as there is no unnecessary weight. The finish is nice and round but fully dry. The complex limestone blend brings great acid balance and a certain weight. It should develop very nicely over the next few years.","price":"$45.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/467219-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8775000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fzind-humbrecht-calcaire-pinot-gris-2015%2F208573"}]},"instructions":"Preparation                                        Shrimp                Bring 3 quarts of water and a pinch of salt to a boil over high heat in the saucepan. Add the shrimp, lower the heat to medium, and simmer uncovered for 1 minute. Drain the shrimp and cool them to room temperature.                                                            Marinade                Combine the tomato, bell pepper, shallot, garlic, chopped basil, lemon juice, oil, salt, and black pepper in the bowl with a metal spoon. Add the cooled shrimp, toss well, and marinate in the refrigerator for 4 to 6 hours. (As the shrimp marinate, they get more garlicky.)                                                                Drain the shrimp, reseason with additional salt and black pepper, and arrange them in a flat basket or on a black rectangular or round serving tray. Place the whole basil leaves in the center of the platter and serve with Ginger Yogurt Dip.                                                            Ginger Yogurt Dip                Combine the yogurt, lemon juice, ginger, and garlic in the bowl. Add the salt and pepper to taste. Whisk well until the mixture is smooth.

Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the scallops for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, until they are golden brown and opaque in the center when tested with the tip of a knife. Cut them in quarters and follow the instructions for the shrimp recipe.KITCHENWARE: chef's knife, medium saucepan, colander, large glass or stainless-steel bowl, pepper mill, metal spoon.
