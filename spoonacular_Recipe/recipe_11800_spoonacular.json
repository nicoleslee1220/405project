Slightly off-dry on the palate, this vintage unveils a bouquet of ripe cantaloupe, guava, and nectarine aromas which are balanced with delicate spices such as ginger and cardamom. The finish is long and elegant.\nThis Gewurztraminer is versatile and can be paired with smoked salmon as well as ginger-braised pork, Southeast Asian cuisine such as red coconut curry, Indian, or Moroccan-style dishes.
