Place the mix into a kitchen towel and drain out the water. Transfer back to the bowl and fold in the flour, Parmesan and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Add the egg yolk and gently mix so all the ingredients are well incorporated.Add a good drizzle of vegetable oil to a non-stick pan or skillet. Once the oil is hot, drop a heaping tablespoon of the potato mixture and flatten to form a disc with the back of a spoon. Cook for 1-2 minutes or until the side in contact with the skillet is nice and golden brown. Flip the fritters and cook the other side for 1-2 minutes. Remove from the heat and place on paper towels to soak up excess oil.Sauce:1/2 cup sour cream1 tablespoon finely chopped parsleySalt and freshly ground pepperWhisk the sour cream and parsley in a small bowl. Add a pinch of salt and pepper and serve alongside the fritters.Pin itChocolate Cake with Apples and HazelnutsAdapted from Valrhona, serves 82 small Granny Smith apples1/3 cup of hazelnuts, chopped250 grams of bittersweet chocolate, chopped2/3 cup of heavy whipping cream3 egg yolks4 teaspoons of cornstarch3 tablespoons of liquid honey3 egg whitesConfectioner's sugarPreheat your oven to 375F.Prepare an 8-inch or 9-inch springform pan (at least 2 inches deep) and grease the bottom and the sides. Peel, core, and slice the apples into 1/2-inch dice and set aside.Chop the chocolate and place in a bowl. In a small saucepan, bring the heavy cream to a light boil and immediately remove from the heat.. Pour the cream over the chocolate. Using a rubber spatula, fold the mixture until the chocolate and cream form a homogeneous mix. Once the mixture has cooled, slowly mix in the egg yolks and cornstarch until thoroughly incorporated. The mixture will be smooth and slightly thick.In a separate bowl, add the honey to the egg whites and whip until soft peaks form.Using a whisk, add about 1/3 of the whipped egg whites to the chocolate mixture to lighten the mixture. Don't worry about breaking the whites at this point, just whisk in the whites to make the batter more malleable. Then, gently fold in the remaining egg whites in two batches, and avoid over-mixing. White streaks of egg white should still be visible in the chocolate mixture.Pour the batter into the greased springform pan. Top with the chopped apples and hazelnuts and dust lightly with confectioner's sugar. Place the springform pan on a cookie sheet or sheet pan and bake immediately.Cook for 30 to 35 minutes or until a wooden skewer inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean. Be careful not to overcook or the cake will become flaky and dry.Let the cake cool in the springform pan for at least 15 minutes before unmolding. The cake is best enjoyed while still warm.Pin itCaramel-Coated ApplesMakes about 10 caramel apples10 apples (I used Spartan)3/4 cup granulated sugar1/4 lightly packed brown sugar2 tablespoons unsalted butter1/4 cup light corn syrup2 teaspoons molasses1/4 teaspoon kosher salt1/2 cup heavy creamWash the apples and thoroughly dry them - if they are still wet the caramel will not stick to the skin. Remove the stems and insert a wooden stick at the top of each apple, about half-way through. The apples should securely cling to the stick. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly grease.In a saucepan on medium heat, add the sugars, butter, corn syrup, molasses, salt and half of the cream. Swirl the pan to make sure all the ingredients mix homogenously. Once they have, add the remaining cream. Cook on medium heat for 10-12 minutes or until the temperature of the mixture reaches 240F.Remove the caramel from the heat and wait for the liquid to slightly cool (2 minutes). Using a swirling motion and carefully tilting the pan, coat the apples with caramel, leaving an untouched circle of apple where the wooden stick is inserted. Let the excess caramel drip off, and place the apples on the parchment paper. Immediately place the apples in the fridge to harden. You may have to do this in batches so that the first coated apples don't stay at room temperature for too long: the quicker they get in the fridge, the better! If the caramel starts to harden and is not thin enough to coat the apples, simply place the saucepan on the heat for a couple minutes before coating more apples.Leave the apples in the fridge for at least 15 minutes to harden. Once they have hardened, leave at room temperature.
