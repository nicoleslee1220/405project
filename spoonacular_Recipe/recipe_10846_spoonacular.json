Butter and flour a 9-inch square baking pan. In a large bowl, whisk the flour with the cornmeal, baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs to mix, then whisk in the milk, butter and honey. Using a rubber spatula, lightly stir the wet ingredients into the dry; stir until just blended. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 25 minutes, or until the corn bread springs back when lightly pressed. Transfer the corn bread to a rack to cool. Cut half of the corn bread into 3/4-inch cubes. Wrap the remaining corn bread and reserve for another use.                                              In a medium saucepan of boiling salted water, cook the brussels sprouts until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Drain and slice lengthwise 1/3-inch thick.                                              In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil until shimmering. Add the corn bread cubes, sprinkle with the crushed red pepper and cook over high heat until browned all over, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer to a platter. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the skillet. Add the brussels sprouts and cook over moderately high heat, stirring, until hot, about 1 minute. Season with salt and black pepper and gently stir in the corn bread. Transfer the hash to the platter; serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 40","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Butter and flour a 9-inch square baking pan.
