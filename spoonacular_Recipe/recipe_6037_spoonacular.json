In a blender or food processor, combine the garlic, ginger, Worcestershire sauce, coriander, curry powder, cloves, jalapeo and 1/2 cup of oil and puree. Season with salt and pepper.

Add the coconut milk, lime juice, brown sugar, soy sauce and a pinch of salt and simmer for 4 minutes. If the sauce separates, return to the food processor and process until it comes together.
