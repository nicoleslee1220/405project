Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Thrive Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 15 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":488256,"title":"Thrive Pinot Grigio","description":"","price":"$14.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/488256-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9,"ratingCount":10.0,"score":0.867741935483871,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fthrive-pinot-grigio-2018%2F522678"}]},"instructions":"Grilled Fish Sambal:Prepare the sambal by grinding chilies, shallots, belacan and lemongrass in a food processor. Make sure the sambal paste is well blended and smooth.Heat up a wok and tumis (stir-fry) the sambal paste until aromatic or when the oil separates from the sambal paste. Add the seasonings: salt, sugar, and fish sauce and do a quick stir, dish out and set aside.Sambal Belacan and Sliced Shallots Condiment:Soak the tamarind pulp with water for 15 minutes and extract the juice. In a mortar and pestle or food processor, pound/blend the red chilies, birds eye chilies, and toasted belacan. Add tamarind juice, sugar, salt, and sliced shallots to the sambal. Stir well and set aside.Grilled Fish with Banana Leaf:Grease a flat pan (I used a Japanese tamagoyaki pan) and then lay a few sheets of banana leaves in the pan. Add 1 tablespoon of cooking oil on top of the banana leaves and spread the oil evenly. Lay the fish on top of the banana leaves and add 3 tablespoons of sambal on top of the fish. Heat up the pan on your stove top over medium heat and cover it with a lid. (Use a towel to cover the corners of the pan in case the lid is too small to completely cover the pan. This will ensure the heat traps inside the pan during the grilling process.) Wait for 8 minutes or so and flip the fish over to the other side. Add 3 more tablespoons of sambal on the other side. Cook for another 8 minutes or so. By then, you can smell the sweet aroma of burnt banana leaves and grilled fish. Dish out and serve immediately with sambal belacan and sliced shallots condiment.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Grilled Fish Sambal:Prepare the sambal by grinding chilies, shallots, belacan and lemongrass in a food processor.
