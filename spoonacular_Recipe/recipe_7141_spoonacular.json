Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Menage a Trois Limelight Pinot Grigio. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 11 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":492092,"title":"Menage a Trois Limelight Pinot Grigio","description":"Ménage à Trois Limelight shines a spotlight on refreshing citrus flavors in the most dazzling way.
