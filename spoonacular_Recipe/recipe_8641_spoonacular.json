This vegan arugula salad that I tasted at the Dole Fresh Vegetables headquarters really won me over. So I re-made it last night - salad-licious.Here's to the salad that saved dinnertime..Arugula Mango Avo Mac Saladinspired by Dole's Salad Summit - makes one giant bowl1 large mango, cubed1 avocado, diced3/4 cup macadamia nuts, roasted/salted5 cups fresh arugulaoptional add-in's: sweet onions, diced apple, diced pineapple ... moredressing (or use your own recipe):1/4 cup lemon juice2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar1/4 cup olive oil1 Tbsp Dijon mustard1 tsp agave syruppepperdash garlic powderDirections:1. I made a quickie salad dressing out of a few of my favorite flavors. Whisked it together and tossed it with the salad ingredients - except the arugula!2. I tossed the avocado, mango and nuts with the salad dressing - then poured it right over the greens. I didn't toss the salad together until we were ready to serve the salad. Otherwise the arugula would get quite soggy.3. Top with fresh black pepper! Serve!..Salad to the Rescue!! Good thing I had the salad prepared, because dinner was a #fail.Last night was one of those evenings where 5pm rolls around. Then suddenly, 5pm flashes to 6pm. Then it's 7pm and before you know it I'm still hunched over my computer at 8pm. And now suddenly I'm missing Dancing with the Stars. Gasp. Actually, maybe that's a good thing.Type, type, type. No end in site.  \"Stop working!\" my brain shouts. But I trek on into the night, forgetting about dinner, forgetting about the ticking clock and feeling oh so nice about being productive.\"It's 9 o'clock?\" .. long pause as I stare fuzzily at my screen. Click. Off. Goodbye screen, hello dinnertime.Yes indeed, I fell back on my salad. I knew I had this giant, gorgeous salad waiting in the fridge - so really, who cares what else goes with it, right? A few smoky tempeh cubes or strips on top for added protein. We also added a few light sandwiches along side this salad feast. And it was about 11pm when we finally ate dinner. But it was a nice prize for a long day of work - diving into a giant salad bowl, my day can always end on a high note!And this salad shows a lot of restraint for me. Usually I pile on the toppings - so only 4 main ingredients - was a pleasantly delicious and simple surprise.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In part three of my wrap-up posts (part 1 - part","ingredients":[{"id":10018364,"name":"wrap","localizedName":"wrap","image":"flour-tortilla.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"you'll get Dole's take on \"Salad 101\" - and for us bloggers, that meant tasting a few salads.
