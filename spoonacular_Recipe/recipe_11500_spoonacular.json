After precise hand-picking, the wine was fermented with native yeasts and then aged entirely in concrete amphoras made from the rocks of the vineyards surrounding Zuccardi’s winery.Intense dark red color with violet hues. This wine expresses layered earth and herbal characters interwoven with flavors of juicy raspberry and black cherry. Full-bodied and smooth with a long finish and a distinctive mineral texture that translates the texture of the unique soils of the vineyard. A wine of great structure and balance.","price":"$79.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/495208-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.96,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8975,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fzuccardi-amphora-malbec-2018%2F635877"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 450F.
