Add the orange juice and pour 1 tbsp soy sauce in there. Stir until the syrup has dissolved. This could take a minute or so. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a stir-fry pan (wok) and sautee the onions for 5 minutes, until soft but not brown. Add the ginger and cook for an additional minute.Add the beet slices and stir fry for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the orange/syrup mix in there. Season with a good pinch of black pepper and salt.
