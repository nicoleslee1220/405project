Do not let it boil. 2 In separate pot (thick-bottomed), heat 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat, and saut the minced shallots for 2-3 minutes, until just translucent.3 Add the rice to the pot. Stir-fry the rice for 2-3 minutes, until all the grains are well coated in butter and are beginning to toast. 4 Increase the heat to high and add the white wine. With a wooden spoon, stir the rice vigorously. Once the wine boils, turn the heat down until the wine is just simmering gently. Stir almost constantly. You are doing this to agitate the rice, which releases its starch and creates the creamy sauce you want in a risotto. 5 When the wine is almost cooked away  under no circumstances should you let the rice sizzle on the bottom of the pot  pour in two ladles of the hot clam broth-water mixture. Stir well to combine, and add a healthy pinch of salt. 6 Stirring almost constantly, let this liquid reduce until it is almost gone, then add another ladle of broth. Continue this until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. Taste the spoon and see if the risotto needs salt. If so, add a small pinch. This much risotto rice should need about 4-5 cups of liquid total (including the wine) to come together, so start tasting the rice at the 3rd cup. If it is almost there  firm in the center but translucent on the outside, and fully surrounded with a creamy sauce  add one more cup of broth, stir well, and taste one more time for salt. (If not, you have old rice and youll need to go one more cup and let it cook away.) 7 Now add in the shrimp, the parsley, and the remaining tablespoon of butter. Stir constantly until this last cup of broth is about half gone: Remember you want this risotto to be loose and creamy. Right before you serve, add in the lemon zest and serve at once. Best served with bowls and spoons rather than plates and forks.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add the clam juice to 4 cups of water in a pot, heat until steamy.
