Try pairing with Merlot, Pinot Noir, and rosé Wine. Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. You could try Enate Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot.

A complex blackcurrant, blackberry aroma with a touch of violet and hints of red pepper, vanilla and herbs.
