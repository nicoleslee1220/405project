Toss the shiitakes with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Spread them on a baking sheet and roast for about 20 minutes, turning once, until tender and barely crisp.

In a bowl, toss the shallots with the flour, shaking off the excess. Working in 2 batches, fry the shallots over high heat, stirring, until golden and crisp, about 6 minutes.
