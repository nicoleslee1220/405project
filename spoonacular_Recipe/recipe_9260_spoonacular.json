Cut them into julienne strips by first thinly slicing them, then cutting into strips about  inch wide. Set aside.                                                    Place a heavy pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat. Add the oil, and when it is hot, add 4 of the curry leaves, the minced chiles, and shallots. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the beets and stir, then add the vinegar, salt, and sugar and stir and turn to mix well. Raise the heat to high and stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes. The beets will give off a little liquid as they cook.                                                    Mix half the coconut milk with the water, then add to the pot and bring to a vigorous boil. Stir well, cover tightly, reduce the heat, and cook at a strong simmer until the beets are just tender, about 20 minutes or so. Check the water level after 10 minutes of cooking and add a little more if it is almost dry.                                                    Add the remaining  cup coconut milk and remaining curry leaves. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and taste for seasoning. Sprinkle on coarse salt, if you wish. Transfer to a serving dish, and serve hot or at room temperature.                                                    Variations:                                                    Carrots with Tropical Flavors: The same method and flavorings can be used to cook carrots. Peel the carrots and cut them into julienne. Follow the instructions above, but decrease the vinegar to 2 teaspoons and the sugar to  teaspoon. Top the cooked carrots with chopped coriander leaves.                                                    Precooked Beets with Tropical Flavors: You can make a quick (10- to 15-minute) version of this dish using 2 to 3 cups chopped, already cooked and peeled beets, now available in many grocery stores. (Canned beets are not a substitute.) Chop the beets into bite-size cubes. All the other ingredients remain the same, except that the coconut milk should be reduced to  cup. Follow the instructions above, but add all the curry leaves with the chiles. Stir-fry the beets for only a minute, and after you add the liquid, simmer the beets for only 5 to 10 minutes, partly covered. Transfer to a shallow bowl, taste for seasoning, and adjust, if you wish. Let cool to room temperature before serving.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                var articleType_27_data = {};                    articleType_27_data.init_step_by_step_images = 0;","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Peel the beets.","ingredients":[{"id":11080,"name":"beet","localizedName":"beet","image":"beets.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Cut them into julienne strips by first thinly slicing them, then cutting into strips about  inch wide.
