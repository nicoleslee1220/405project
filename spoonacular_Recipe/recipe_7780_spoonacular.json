Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine.

It costs about 28 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428265,"title":"Miranda Lambert County Road Merlot Wine","description":"Our most robust spirit is full of fruity flavor and powerful color yet smooth in texture and delivery.
