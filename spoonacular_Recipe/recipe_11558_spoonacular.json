Soil and micro-climate humidity during the 2017 growing season remained quite high through the growing season due to the enormous rains from the previous winter, contributing to the development of modest yet meaningful early botrytis. We last encountered these conditions in 2013 and produced a wine similar to that vintage - just off dry in the style known by the French as sec tendre - dry, yet tender. And as with previous vintages, this wine fermented in stainless steel without inoculation, and was aged until the following Spring in 8 stainless and 2 neutral Hungarian oak barrels.","price":"$25.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/478838-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8175000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbirichino-jurassic-park-vineyard-old-vines-chenin-blanc-2015%2F400659"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"sourceName":null,"creditsText":null,"originalId":null}
