Scrub beets, trim tops and place on a parchment lined rimmed baking sheet.  Drizzle 2 teaspoons olive oil over and sprinkle with the sage, salt and pepper.  Cover tightly with aluminum foil and roast in the oven for 40 minutes, or until the beets are tender and a knife inserts easily.  Allow to cool for 20 minutes.  Use a paper towel or your hands and slip the outer skin off and discard.  Add the beets to a food processor and process until smooth.In a medium bowl add 1 1/2 cups beet puree, ricotta cheese, manchego cheese, egg, salt and 2 cups of flour.  Mix will to combine.  Add more flour until the dough is soft and only slightly sticky.  Allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.  Divide into 8 pieces and lightly dust the cut edges with flour to prevent sticking.Have ready a generously floured rimmed baking sheet for the formed gnocchi.  Set aside.  Flour a large board generously and using your hands make a long rope the width of your finger with the first piece of dough.  Cut into 1 inch pieces and lightly toss with flour to coat the cut edges.  Use a fork or gnocchi board to form the gnocchi, by placing the piece of dough on the tines of the fork and using your thumb to gently drag it down the fork.  It should curl a little as it goes down. Add to the prepared baking sheet and repeat with the remaining dough.  NOTE: do not pile the gnocchi, or they will stick to each other.  This may require 2 rimmed baking sheets.Get a large pot of water boiling and salt.  In a large saute pan, add the 3 tablespoons butter and sage and turn to medium-low heat.  Add the 1/3 of the gnocchi to the boiling water (or less depending on your pot size) and allow them to cook until they float.  Use a spider or slotted spoon to remove the gnocchi from the top of the water and add to the butter/sage saute pan.  Repeat with remaining gnocchi.  Toss lightly to coat with the butter and serve on a warmed platter topped with more machego cheese.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
