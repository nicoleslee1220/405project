Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Anne Amie Pinot Gris with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":447981,"title":"Anne Amie Pinot Gris","description":"Aromas of Bartlett pear, gardenia, white peach, white tea, jasmine, graham cracker, and straw.
