Spread the hazelnuts in a pie plate and toast for 8 minutes, or until fragrant. Let the nuts cool, then coarsely chop them.                                              In a small saucepan, boil the chicken stock until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 15 minutes; keep warm.                                              Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Meanwhile, in a large, deep skillet, cook the bacon over moderately high heat until crisp, about 6 minutes. Drain the bacon on paper towels. Add the butter to the skillet and cook over moderately high heat until browned and nutty, about 3 minutes. Add the Brussels sprouts and hazelnuts and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Add the orecchiette along with the reduced chicken stock and simmer, stirring, until the sauce is slightly absorbed, about 2 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup of the Parmigiano cheese, season with salt and pepper and transfer to a large serving bowl. Garnish with the bacon and the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 37","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Spread the hazelnuts in a pie plate and toast for 8 minutes, or until fragrant.","ingredients":[{"id":12120,"name":"hazelnuts","localizedName":"hazelnuts","image":"hazelnuts.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"spread","localizedName":"spread","image":""},{"id":18070,"name":"toast","localizedName":"toast","image":"toast"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":8,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Let the nuts cool, then coarsely chop them.","ingredients":[{"id":12135,"name":"nuts","localizedName":"nuts","image":"nuts-mixed.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"In a small saucepan, boil the chicken stock until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 15 minutes; keep warm.","ingredients":[{"id":6172,"name":"chicken stock","localizedName":"chicken stock","image":"chicken-broth.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","localizedName":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}],"length":{"number":15,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":5,"step":"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","localizedName":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":6,"step":"Add the Brussels sprouts, cover and cook until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.
