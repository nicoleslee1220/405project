Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. The Tinga Rio Reserve Merlot with a 4.8 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":494870,"title":"Tinga Rio Reserve Merlot","description":"Ruby red in color with notes of raspberries and strawberries on the nose.
