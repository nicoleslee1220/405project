The Ribera del Duero and Tinta de Toro vines grown on our estate contribute the familiar varietal flavors, while the traditional Rioja blending grape Graciano adds tannin and structure. Pronounced aromatics of ripe raspberry and rich plum lead to enticing flavors of earth, spicy cardamom and dark fruit. Smooth and soft on the palate, this seductive red has a bright finish that begs for another sip of this finely structured wine. Pair this Dunnigan Hills Tempranillo with a traditional Paella dish infused with saffron, mussels, shrimp and chorizo.","price":"$14.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/453462-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9199999999999999,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8574999999999999,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fmatchbook-tempranillo-2010%2F128990"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"originalId":null}
