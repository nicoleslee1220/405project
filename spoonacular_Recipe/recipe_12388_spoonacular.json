Pour into a large bowl. Add a bit of broth to pan and stir to scrape up browned bits. Add to bowl.                                                                                                 Pour 2 cups broth into bowl and add bread, artichoke hearts, parmesan, poultry seasoning, and rosemary; mix well. Add salt and pepper to taste. Make a well in stuffing. Add egg and beat with a fork to blend; mix egg with stuffing.                                                                                                 Preheat oven to 325 to 350 (use temperature turkey requires; see Note below). Spoon stuffing into a shallow 3-qt. (9- by 13-in.) casserole. For moist stuffing, cover with foil; for crusty stuffing, do not cover. Bake until hot (at least 150 in center) or lightly browned, about 50 minutes.
