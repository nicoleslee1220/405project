These low-tannin, lower alcohol wines will complement the heat in spicy cajun dishes, instead of making your mouth burn more.

It is a very intense wine on the nose with persistent quality aromas, recalling green apple and tropical fruit, such as pineapple. On the palate, it is long and persistent with a perfect acidity that matches its body, making it a very pleasant wine full of sensations. This delightfully crisp and refreshing wine is hand harvested in small plastic boxes. The grapes are selected and pressed. Once the must is obtained, an alcoholic fermentation process begins, which is carried out in stainless-steel vats at a temperature of 64 degrees Fahrenheit. Following the fermentation period, a racking is performed to separate the lees; it subsequently undergoes a cold stabilization, it is filtered and then finally bottled.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/494254-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9800000000000001,"ratingCount":12.0,"score":0.952972972972973,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fatlantis-albarino-2019%2F626795"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"sourceName":null,"creditsText":null,"originalId":null}
