Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. One wine you could try is Robert Mondavi Napa Merlot. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 30 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":438573,"title":"Robert Mondavi Napa Merlot","description":"The wine's multi-dimensional flavors come from grapes grown in distinctly different terroirs of Napa Valley, including the Carneros, Stags Leap and Oakville districts. Traditional techniques, including native yeasts, extended maceration, aging in French oak barrels and bottling without filtration, enhanced the wine's complexity. This wine is delicious with many entrees and cheeses. One of our favorite food pairings is roast turkey with a wild mushroom and walnut stuffing. Roast leg of lamb, rubbed with fragrant herbs and spices, or grilled pork loin also marry perfectly with the wine's luscious flavors.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438573-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":25.0,"score":0.7868421052631579,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Frobert-mondavi-napa-merlot-1999%2F51817"}]},"instructions":"Preheat grill.                                                                                                Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add lima beans; cook 20 minutes or until tender. Drain. Add vinegar and oil, tossing well.                                                                                                Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add green beans and yellow wax beans; cook 7 minutes or until crisp-tender. Drain and combine lima beans, green beans, yellow wax beans, tomatoes, and basil in a large bowl. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; set aside.                                                                                                Coat both sides of tuna with cooking spray; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Place tuna on a grill rack coated with cooking spray; cook 2 minutes on each side or until desired degree of doneness. Cut each steak crosswise into 1/4-inch slices; arrange over bean mixture.                                                                                                Wine note: The perfect wine for a summer salad needs to be refreshing and crisp, while at the same time capable of standing up to the \"meatiness\" of the grilled tuna and the acidity inherent in tomatoes. My favorite choice comes from France: Sancerre. (Sancerres are always made from sauvignon blanc grapes.) Try the Pascal Jolivet Sancerre 2003 (Loire Valley, France, $25), which is snappy, fresh, and full of citrus flavors. -Karen MacNeil","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat grill.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404706,"name":"grill","localizedName":"grill","image":"grill.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","localizedName":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add lima beans; cook 20 minutes or until tender.","ingredients":[{"id":16072,"name":"lima beans","localizedName":"lima beans","image":"broad-beans.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":20,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Drain.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Add vinegar and oil, tossing well.","ingredients":[{"id":2053,"name":"vinegar","localizedName":"vinegar","image":"vinegar-(white).jpg"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":6,"step":"Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","localizedName":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":7,"step":"Add green beans and yellow wax beans; cook 7 minutes or until crisp-tender.","ingredients":[{"id":93711,"name":"yellow wax beans","localizedName":"yellow wax beans","image":"yellow-wax-beans.png"},{"id":11052,"name":"green beans","localizedName":"green beans","image":"green-beans-or-string-beans.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":7,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":8,"step":"Drain and combine lima beans, green beans, yellow wax beans, tomatoes, and basil in a large bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":93711,"name":"yellow wax beans","localizedName":"yellow wax beans","image":"yellow-wax-beans.png"},{"id":11052,"name":"green beans","localizedName":"green beans","image":"green-beans-or-string-beans.jpg"},{"id":16072,"name":"lima beans","localizedName":"lima beans","image":"broad-beans.jpg"},{"id":11529,"name":"tomato","localizedName":"tomato","image":"tomato.png"},{"id":2044,"name":"basil","localizedName":"basil","image":"basil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":9,"step":"Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; set aside.","ingredients":[{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","localizedName":"pepper","image":"pepper.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":10,"step":"Coat both sides of tuna with cooking spray; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":4679,"name":"cooking spray","localizedName":"cooking spray","image":"cooking-spray.png"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","localizedName":"pepper","image":"pepper.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":10015121,"name":"tuna","localizedName":"tuna","image":"canned-tuna.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":11,"step":"Place tuna on a grill rack coated with cooking spray; cook 2 minutes on each side or until desired degree of doneness.","ingredients":[{"id":4679,"name":"cooking spray","localizedName":"cooking spray","image":"cooking-spray.png"},{"id":10015121,"name":"tuna","localizedName":"tuna","image":"canned-tuna.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404706,"name":"grill","localizedName":"grill","image":"grill.jpg"}],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":12,"step":"Cut each steak crosswise into 1/4-inch slices; arrange over bean mixture.","ingredients":[{"id":23232,"name":"steak","localizedName":"steak","image":"ribeye-raw.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":13,"step":"Wine note: The perfect wine for a summer salad needs to be refreshing and crisp, while at the same time capable of standing up to the \"meatiness\" of the grilled tuna and the acidity inherent in tomatoes.
