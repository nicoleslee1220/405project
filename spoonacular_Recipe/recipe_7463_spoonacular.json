Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Jean Biecher Pinot Gris with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":2045398,"title":"Jean Biecher Pinot Gris","description":"This Pinot Gris has a beautiful yellow-gold color. Rich in aromatic complexity, Pinot Gris can reveal typically smoky notes as well as delicious aromas of dried fruit, apricot, honey, beeswax and gingerbread. This ample and fleshy wine is sustained by a delightful tension which gives the wine a full-bodied structure. The finish is long and well balanced.ave a noble, velvety texture sometimes with smooth and silky nuances.\nWith its richness of expression, Pinot Gris sports a natural audacity, able to be matched with dishes usually for red wines. With its hint of earthy and smoky undergrowth, Pinot Gris d’Alsace makes an admirable match for pan-fried girolle mushrooms, risotto with boletus mushrooms.","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/2045398-312x231.jpg","averageRating":1.0,"ratingCount":8.0,"score":0.96,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fjean-biecher-pinot-gris-2020%2F759987"}]},"instructions":"In a medium skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add the garlic and cook over moderately high heat until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the wine and boil until reduced by half, about 1 minute. Add the chicken stock and boil until reduced by half again, about 1 minute. Remove the skillet from the heat and whisk in the cold butter, 1 tablespoon at a time.                                               In another medium skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the oil. Add the shiitake caps and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in the sesame seeds and cook, stirring frequently, until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Season the shiitake with salt and pepper and remove the skillet from the heat.                                               On a plate, toss the pumpkin seeds with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and the cayenne. Press the boned side of the trout fillets into the pumpkin seeds to coat.                                               In a large nonstick skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. Add the trout fillets, crusted side down, and cook over moderately high heat until browned, about 2 minutes. Turn the fillets and cook until the fish is just white throughout and the skin is crisp, about 3 minutes. Transfer the fillets to plates.
