To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. One wine you could try is Hindsight Wines Chardonnay. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 26 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":495204,"title":"Hindsight Wines Chardonnay","description":"Our 2018 Chardonnay is sourced from vineyards in Carneros and Oak Knoll.

Cover, reduce the heat to moderately low and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.                                              Strain the broth into a bowl. Working in batches, puree the solids in a blender, adding just enough of the broth to make a smooth puree. Return the puree and the remaining broth to a clean saucepan.
