White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The Antica Chardonnay (Mountain Select) with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 29 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":478030,"title":"Antica Chardonnay (Mountain Select)","description":"The 2017 Chardonnay is vibrant and rich with enticing aromas that lead to a firm core of pear, apple and apricot flavors shaded by lightly-spiced oak.
