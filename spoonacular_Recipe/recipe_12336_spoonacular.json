Heat 2 tbsp. oil in a 4-qt. pot over medium heat. Add carrot, onion, and celery and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to a bowl and add peas; set aside.                                                                                                 Add remaining 1 tbsp. oil to pot. Add flour and whisk until dry and crumbly, about 30 seconds. Pour in milk 1/4 cup at a time, whisking well after each addition until smooth and creamy (mixture will be paste-like at first). Add reserved vegetables, salt, pepper, and chicken to milk mixture, stirring gently to combine. Spoon mixture into a large gratin dish (about 2 1/2 qts.) or ovenproof frying pan. Sprinkle with tarragon.                                                                                                 Mix bread and butter together in a large bowl, tossing well to coat.
