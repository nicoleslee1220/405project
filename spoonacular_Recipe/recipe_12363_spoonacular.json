Buttery chardonnay is great for scallops, shrimp, crab, and lobster, while muscadet is a classic pick for mussels, oysters, and clams. If you've got some spice in your shellfish, a semi-dry riesling can balance out the heat. The Aubert Lauren Vineyard Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 139 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":441715,"title":"Aubert Lauren Vineyard Chardonnay","description":"The 2011 Lauren Estate Chardonnay always reminds one of a hypothetical vintage blend of Sonoma Coast meets White Burgundy. This 2011 Lauren is naturally clear with green chlorophyll tints on edge. Aromatics are classic Lauren with nuances of lemon-mineral, dried pear and even some green tea-like tones. The pronounced aromatics of fruits and minerals give an organic sense of place. The bouquet is multi-faceted with hints of apple-baked goods and wet stones. The mouth feel presents a glycerin top note, followed by an acid structure only found at Lauren.The wine has a slight hazy clarity showing Aubert's commitment to minimal interventional winemaking.","price":"$139.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/441715-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8175000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Faubert-lauren-vineyard-chardonnay-2011%2F122070"}]},"instructions":"Combine first 3 ingredients in a medium bowl.
