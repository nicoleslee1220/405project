These crisp white wines work well with shrimp prepared in a variety of ways, whether grilled, fried, or in garlic sauce.

The warm, sun-exposed vineyards of the Anger sites, with their loamy limestone gravel soils, are a textbook example. The Anger Alto Adige Pinot Grigio has a noble structure, nice balance and fine acidity – making it an absolute pleasure to drink.
