In a large (12-inch) skillet, heat the olive oil on high heat. Pat the shrimp dry with paper towels and add them to the skillet. Sprinkle with 3/4 tsp. kosher salt and sear until theyre pink and a little golden on one side, about 1 minute. Sprinkle the garlic, pimentn, and red pepper flakes over the shrimp, and saut, stirring, until the shrimp are almost completely pink, about 1 minute. Add the sherry and cook, stirring to deglaze the bottom of the pan, until the shrimp are pink all over (the sherry will evaporate quickly but you should still have some juices in the pan)    Remove from the heat. Toss with the lemon zest and chives. Pour the shrimp and juices into a serving dish, squeeze on lemon juice to taste, and serve.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Size                        :                      based on eight servings, Calories                        (kcal):                      140, Fat                        (kcal):                      6, Fat Calories                        (g):                      50, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      1, Protein                        (g):                      18, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      4, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      1, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      1, Sodium                        (g):                      400, Cholesterol                        (g):                      165, Fiber                        (g):                      0,                     Photo: Scott Phillips          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Sprinkle the shrimp with 3/4 tsp. kosher salt, toss, and let sit for 10 minutes (or refrigerate for up to 1 hour).
