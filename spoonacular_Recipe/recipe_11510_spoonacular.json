Chardonnay suits simple chops or chops in a butter or cream sauce, dry riesling complements sweet additions like honey mustard or apples, and pinot noir is a safe bet for pork dishes in general.

Add the pork chops and turn to coat. Let stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour and for up to 4 hours or refrigerate overnight.                                              Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, boil the veal stock until reduced to 1 tablespoon, about 15 minutes.                                              In a saucepan, heat the pure olive oil until shimmering. Add the shallot and garlic and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in the Dijon mustard and half of the whole-grain mustard. Add the brandy and cook until nearly evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add the wine; simmer until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Add the cream, Worcestershire sauce and reduced veal stock and simmer until thickened, about 15 minutes. Strain the mustard sauce into a heatproof bowl. Whisk in the remaining whole-grain mustard; season with salt and white pepper. Cover and keep warm.                                              Preheat the oven to 450. Season the pork chops with salt. Heat a large ovenproof skillet. Add the chops and cook over moderate heat for 2 minutes. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for about 6 minutes, or until the chops are golden on the bottom. Turn the chops and continue roasting until just cooked through, about 7 minutes.                                              Transfer the pork chops to plates. Strain the pan juices into the mustard sauce and simmer until heated through. Spoon the mustard cream sauce alongside. Mound the Alsatian Cabbage next to the chops and serve at once.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large glass baking dish, combine the peppercorns with the thyme and extra-virgin olive oil.","ingredients":[{"id":1034053,"name":"extra virgin olive oil","localizedName":"extra virgin olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":1022030,"name":"peppercorns","localizedName":"peppercorns","image":"black-pepper.png"},{"id":2049,"name":"thyme","localizedName":"thyme","image":"thyme.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":406921,"name":"glass baking pan","localizedName":"glass baking pan","image":"glass-baking-tray.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the pork chops and turn to coat.","ingredients":[{"id":10010062,"name":"pork chops","localizedName":"pork chops","image":"pork-chops.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Let stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour and for up to 4 hours or refrigerate overnight.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":300,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, boil the veal stock until reduced to 1 tablespoon, about 15 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":1006170,"name":"veal stock","localizedName":"veal stock","image":"beef-broth.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","localizedName":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}],"length":{"number":15,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":5,"step":"In a saucepan, heat the pure olive oil until shimmering.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","localizedName":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":6,"step":"Add the shallot and garlic and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes.
