Set the spice mixture aside.In a mortar using a pestle, crush the garlic cloves with several large pinches of salt until a paste forms. Work in 2 Tbs. of the Cognac.Trim the excess fat from the duck legs. Rinse the legs and pat dry with paper towels. Using a fork, prick the duck skin, taking care not to pierce the flesh. Rub the duck with the garlic paste and sprinkle generously with 1 to 2 Tbs. of the spice mixture. Wrap the legs in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.Preheat an oven to 350F.Scatter the rosemary sprigs in the bottom of a large roasting pan. Place the duck legs in a single layer in the pan without touching and roast for 30 minutes. Spoon off the fat from the pan as it begins to accumulate; too much hot fat can catch fire and can make the duck taste greasy. Scatter the carrot and shallot around the duck and continue roasting until crisp and nicely browned, about 30 minutes more.Meanwhile, in a large, heavy nonreactive saucepan over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the cabbage and cook, stirring, until it wilts, about 7 minutes. Add 2 to 3 Tbs. water, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the cabbage is very tender, about 30 minutes. Add the cream, increase the heat to medium-high and cook, uncovered and stirring, until the liquid is nearly evaporated, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover and keep warm.Using a slotted spoon, remove the carrot and shallot from the roasting pan and transfer to a heavy saucepan. Cover the duck legs in the roasting pan loosely with aluminum foil and set aside.Add the bouquet garni, the remaining 3 Tbs. Cognac, the sliced garlic, wine, stock and tomato paste to the saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, until the liquid is reduced by about one-fourth, 15 to 20 minutes. Add several generous pinches of the remaining spice mixture. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing with the back of a spoon to extract all the liquid. Discard the solids. Return the sauce to the saucepan.Transfer the duck legs to a warmed platter and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Pour the juices from the roasting pan into a small bowl, reserving the pan. Let the juices stand for a few minutes, then spoon off any fat from the surface. Add the juices to the sauce in the saucepan.Set the roasting pan over medium-high heat, pour in the sauce and cook, stirring to scrape up the browned bits, until the sauce is enriched by the pan juices and browned bits, about 5 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings with salt and black pepper.To serve, place a mound of cabbage on individual plates. Top with the duck legs and drizzle with the sauce.
