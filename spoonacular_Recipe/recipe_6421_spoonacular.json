Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Mark West Pinot Grigio with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":490366,"title":"Mark West Pinot Grigio","description":"Crisp and clean, this wine features honeydew, stone fruit, and citrus with a subtle, clean, lingering finish.\nTry pairing with good old fish and chips, summer salads, and steamed clams by the dozen...or dozens.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/490366-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9,"ratingCount":7.0,"score":0.8545454545454546,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fmark-west-pinot-grigio-2017%2F510897"}]},"instructions":"Arrange fish fillets in a baking pan or baking dish.Sprinkle fish with lemon juice, salt and pepper.Broil fish in oven for about 7 to 9 minutes or until fish is opaque.Meanwhile, mix prepared mustard, mayonnaise, green onions and salt.Spread sauce over fish and broil for a couple more minutes or until sauce begin to bubble.Serve immediately with steamed rice and a side of steamed vegetables.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Arrange fish fillets in a baking pan or baking dish.","ingredients":[{"id":10115261,"name":"fish fillets","localizedName":"fish fillets","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404646,"name":"baking pan","localizedName":"baking pan","image":"roasting-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Sprinkle fish with lemon juice, salt and pepper.Broil fish in oven for about 7 to 9 minutes or until fish is opaque.Meanwhile, mix prepared mustard, mayonnaise, green onions and salt.","ingredients":[{"id":2046,"name":"mustard","localizedName":"mustard","image":"regular-mustard.jpg"},{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","localizedName":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":11291,"name":"green onions","localizedName":"green onions","image":"spring-onions.jpg"},{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","localizedName":"lemon juice","image":"lemon-juice.jpg"},{"id":4025,"name":"mayonnaise","localizedName":"mayonnaise","image":"mayonnaise.png"},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}],"length":{"number":7,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Spread sauce over fish and broil for a couple more minutes or until sauce begin to bubble.","ingredients":[{"id":0,"name":"spread","localizedName":"spread","image":""},{"id":0,"name":"sauce","localizedName":"sauce","image":""},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Serve immediately with steamed rice and a side of steamed vegetables.","ingredients":[{"id":10220445,"name":"cooked rice","localizedName":"cooked rice","image":"uncooked-white-rice.png"},{"id":11583,"name":"vegetable","localizedName":"vegetable","image":"mixed-vegetables.png"}],"equipment":[]}]}],"originalId":null}
