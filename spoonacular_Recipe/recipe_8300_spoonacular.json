Place the beets on a baking dish whole, and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until tender. To check for doneness, insert a sharp paring knife through the middle of the thickest part of the beet. If the knife goes through all the way smoothly, the beets are done. Remove from the oven and cool completely. Peel the beets under running water and cut them into thin slices.Arrange 4 to 6 slices of beets on a salad plate in a circle. Toss the arugula with kosher salt and 3 to 4 tablespoons of dressing. Place 1 cup of arugula on top of the beets. Spread 4 to 5 goat-cheese balls around the salad, and top with 2 teaspoons of pignoli nuts.

Lower heat to medium-high and continue to boil until the vinegar starts to thicken and forms a syrup like consistency, about 15 to 20 minutes. Be careful not to thicken too much or you will end up with a thick black goop. To test, use a wooden spoon: if the syrup coats the back of the spoon, it is ready to remove from the heat.
