Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Alsace Willm Pinot Gris Reserve. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 16 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":496346,"title":"Alsace Willm Pinot Gris Reserve","description":"An intense golden color with hints of ocher, the wine has a nose of ripe fruit, quince.

Trim all the fins off the snapper and dry with a paper towel. Put the oven rack in the middle position and preheat to 450 degrees F.Add about 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a large chefs pan and heat over medium high heat. Add the garlic and saute until fragrant. Add the fennel, onion, and bay leaf and saute until the vegetables start turning brown at the edges (about 10 minutes). Add the tomatoes and salt and pepper to taste. Add the parboiled sunchokes, then make a little space in the middle of the pan for the fish.Generously salt and pepper both sides of the snapper as well as the inside, then spread the belly out a little so the fish can sit upright in the pan along with the sauteed vegetables. Drizzle with olive oil and put the pan in the oven.Toss the asparagus with olive oil and salt and pepper. After the fish has been in the oven for 15 minutes, sprinkle the asparagus around the fish and put it back in the oven and continue to cook for another 10-15 minutes, or until the fish is cooked all the way through. You can test it by sticking a fork or knife straight down into the meat around the spine and pulling away the meat. It should come away from the bone easily and be opaque. If it doesn't or the meat looks translucent, cook it a little longer.Sprinkle with chopped mint and serve whole with the vegetables.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Parboil the sunchokes in salted water until they are tender, but not mushy.
