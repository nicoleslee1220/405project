Combine garlic, ginger, both chili pastes, honey, lime juice, salt, pepper, and oil in a large bowl. Whisk thoroughly. Set aside 1 c. of the marinade. Pour remaining mixture over shrimp and refrigerate for at least 24 hours and up to 48 hours.When ready to cook, thread shrimp onto skewers.If using bamboo skewers, soak in water for at least 1/2 hour before skewering anything. Preheat outdoor grill. This really should be done outside because they get VERY smokey! When grill is hot, reduce heat to low and quickly place all skewers over the heat. Brush with reserved marinade. When theyve cooked for 1 1/2-2 minutes,quickly flip them over and brush or drizzle with remaining marinade. Cook for another 1 1/2-2 minutes, or until opaque and pink.Shrimp cook extremely quickly and you dont want to overcook them, but these are pretty forgiving if you do.Remove skewers from grill and remove shrimp from skewers. Pile them on a big ol platter, drizzle with any remaining reserved marinade, and squeeze the juice from a lime all over them.Toss to distribute the deliciousness.
