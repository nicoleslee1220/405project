Rub with pickling spice, and place in the prepared roasting pan. Arrange celery, orange and onion slices on and around the roast.

About 45 minutes before the roasts time is up, heat 3 tablespoons of margarine and 1/4 cup of water in a large pot. Add cabbage and apples, cover, and simmer over low heat for about 30 minutes.
