Place the cucumber, red pepper, and lemon zest in a medium mixing bowl. Pour the dressing over the vegetables. Toss gently to coat. Chill the vegetables and let stand for 1 hour before serving.                          For the puree: In a sauce pot, combine the vinegar, sugar, ginger, and lemon juice. Simmer the mixture over medium-low heat until big bubbles start to form and it becomes a light syrup. Reduce until thickened. Remove the pot from the heat.                          Meanwhile, in a large pot, combine the parsnips, potatoes, and chicken stock, and bring to a boil. Cook until both the parsnips and potatoes are fork tender. Drain the parsnips and potatoes, and mash with the heavy cream, butter, and ginger syrup until smooth. Season the parsnip-potato mash with salt, to taste.                          Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat and add the olive oil, garlic, and shrimp. Cook the shrimp for about 3 minutes, or until cooked through. On a warmed serving platter, make a bed of parsnip puree, top with the shrimp, then top the shrimp with the pickled vegetables and some of the juice.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"For the pickled vegetables","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Whisk together the vinegar, sugar, and salt.","ingredients":[{"id":2053,"name":"vinegar","localizedName":"vinegar","image":"vinegar-(white).jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","localizedName":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","localizedName":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the cucumber, red pepper, and lemon zest in a medium mixing bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":9156,"name":"lemon zest","localizedName":"lemon zest","image":"zest-lemon.jpg"},{"id":11821,"name":"red pepper","localizedName":"red pepper","image":"red-pepper.jpg"},{"id":11206,"name":"cucumber","localizedName":"cucumber","image":"cucumber.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","localizedName":"mixing bowl","image":"mixing-bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Pour the dressing over the vegetables.
