The best wine for Asian food depends on the cuisine and dish - of course - but these acidic whites pair with a number of traditional meals, spicy or not. One wine you could try is Lawson's Dry Hills Gewurztraminer. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":444941,"title":"Lawson's Dry Hills Gewurztraminer","description":"The 2009 Lawson's Dry Hills Gew√ºrztraminer is a wonderful expression of a great vintage. The wine is\nluscious and round with gentle acidity, balanced by a hint of sweetness(9.2g/L). Lemon peel,\nmarmalade, candyfloss, coriander, ginger and floral notes can all be found on the nose. The palate is\nmouthfilling and rich with lovely concentration. Lychee, lemon and Turkish delight flavours lead on to a\nlong spicy finish.
