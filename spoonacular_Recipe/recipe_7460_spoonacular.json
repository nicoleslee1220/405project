Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Anne Amie Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":447981,"title":"Anne Amie Pinot Gris","description":"Aromas of Bartlett pear, gardenia, white peach, white tea, jasmine, graham cracker, and straw.
