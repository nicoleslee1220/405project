Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Thrive Pinot Grigio with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 15 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":488256,"title":"Thrive Pinot Grigio","description":"","price":"$14.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/488256-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9,"ratingCount":10.0,"score":0.867741935483871,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fthrive-pinot-grigio-2018%2F522678"}]},"instructions":"Arrange fish on foil lined greased rimmed baking sheet.Stir together coriander black bean and garlic sauce and garlic.Spoon over fish.Roast in 450f degree oven until fish flakes easily when tested, 12 to 15 minutes.Serve sprinkled with green onions.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Arrange fish on foil lined greased rimmed baking sheet.Stir together coriander black bean and garlic sauce and garlic.Spoon over fish.Roast in 450f degree oven until fish flakes easily when tested, 12 to 15 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":1012013,"name":"coriander","localizedName":"coriander","image":"ground-coriander.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","localizedName":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":0,"name":"sauce","localizedName":"sauce","image":""},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","localizedName":"baking sheet","image":"baking-sheet.jpg"},{"id":404765,"name":"aluminum foil","localizedName":"aluminum foil","image":"aluminum-foil.png"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":450.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}],"length":{"number":12,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Serve sprinkled with green onions.","ingredients":[{"id":11291,"name":"green onions","localizedName":"green onions","image":"spring-onions.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]}],"originalId":null}
