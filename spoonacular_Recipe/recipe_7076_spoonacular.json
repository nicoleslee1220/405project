Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Loveblock Pinot Gris with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":440435,"title":"Loveblock Pinot Gris","description":"Loveblock Pinot Gris is a pale golden with hints of green.

If it appears too thick (like really thick paste), add a little extra mayo. If it appears too creamy, add another few shakes of cheese. Like Rachael Ray says, \"Eyeball it\". The consistency will be thick, but still stir able and slightly creamy.Next, take the fish, one fillet at a time, and coat only one side with mixture, making sure you coat the whole side. Normally about 2-2 1/2 tablespoons of mixture should do it, per piece of fish.Place fish (coating side up) in a slightly greased oven dish and bake on lower rack at 350F for 35 minutes. Don't get worried if it browns some; some browning adds to the flavor. When I bake this, it normally gets light brown all over, so don't worry if you see if turning brown. Also, don't be surprised if the coating mixture slides off a little. This is normal.Serve with stuffing or wild rice, and a salad and you have a great, easy meal.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Mix all liquids and spices together.
