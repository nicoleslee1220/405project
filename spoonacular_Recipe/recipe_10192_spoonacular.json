Add the shiitakes, shallots and ginger and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the lemongrass, basil, cilantro, Chicken Stock and clam juice and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 25 minutes.                                               Strain the broth and return it to the saucepan. Boil over high heat until reduced to 1 cup, about 10 minutes. Add the coconut milk and simmer for 3 minutes.
