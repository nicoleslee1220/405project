Wrap beets tightly in foil to make 2 packages and roast in middle of oven until tender, about 1 1/4hours.                                                                While beets roast, simmer vinegar, water, sugar, and spices, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes. Add onions and simmer, stirring, 2 minutes. Pour pickled onions with liquid and spices into a bowl and cool, stirring occasionally, to room temperature.
