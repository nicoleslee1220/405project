Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine.

Brush the tuna steaks with oil and season with salt. Mix the coriander seeds with the peppercorns and press them onto both sides of the tuna steaks.                                              In a small bowl, combine the vegetable oil with the lime juice, lemongrass, fish sauce, cilantro and chile.                                              In a medium saucepan, steam the snow peas over 1/2 inch of boiling water, covered, until bright green and crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Drain the snow peas, refresh under cold water and pat dry. Transfer to a bowl.                                              Grill the tuna steaks over a hot fire,  turning once, until lightly charred outside and rare in the center, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board.                                              Cut the tuna steaks into thick slices and arrange on 4 plates. Toss the snow peas with 2 tablespoons of the dressing and spoon alongside the tuna.
