A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. You could try Nickel & Nickel Harris Vineyard Merlot.

In a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of the olive oil with the balsamic vinegar, mustard and dill and season with salt and pepper. Slice the potatoes 1/2 inch thick and toss with 2 tablespoons of the dressing. Mound the potato salad on plates.
