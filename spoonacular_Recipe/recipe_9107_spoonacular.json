Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"originalId":null}
