Try pairing with Merlot, Pinot Noir, and rosé Wine. Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. The Raymond R Collection Merlot with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":439335,"title":"Raymond R Collection Merlot","description":"The Merlot fills the mouth with smooth cherry, raspberry and plum flavors along with hints of earth and spice in the toasty vanilla finish.
