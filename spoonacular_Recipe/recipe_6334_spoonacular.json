Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Maysaran Arsheen Pinot Gris with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":476600,"title":"Maysara Arsheen Pinot Gris","description":"A bright expression of fruit right up front, greeting your palate with notes of cut grass on a warm day.

Season the snapper all over with salt and pepper. Let sit at room temperature while you prepare the sauce.    Heat 2 Tbs. of the olive oil in a 12-inch ovenproof skillet over mediumlow heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until softened but not golden, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and their juice, anchovies, olives, 2 Tbs. of the basil, capers, and pepper flakes to the pan. Bring the sauce to a brisk simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are tender and the juices have reduced to a saucy consistency, about 8 minutes.    Nestle the snapper fillets into the sauce, spooning some on top to keep the fish moist. Drizzle with the remaining 1 Tbs. olive oil. Tightly cover the pan with a lid or aluminum foil and braise in the oven until the fish is almost cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes, depending on thickness.    With a slotted spatula, transfer the snapper to 4 shallow serving bowls. If the sauce seems too thin, simmer over medium-high heat until thickened to your liking. Stir the remaining 1 Tbs. basil and the mint and vinegar into the sauce and spoon it over the fish.    Serving Suggestions    Serve with polenta or couscous.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Size                        :                      based on four servings, Calories                        (kcal):                      320, Fat                        (kcal):                      17, Fat Calories                        (g):                      150, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      2.5, Protein                        (g):                      31, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      12, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      12, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      2.5, Sodium                        (g):                      1360, Cholesterol                        (g):                      50, Fiber                        (g):                      0,                     Photo: Scott Phillips          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 325F.
