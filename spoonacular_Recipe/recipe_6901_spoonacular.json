Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Santi Sortesele Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":481300,"title":"Santi Sortesele Pinot Grigio","description":"Straw yellow hue, accompanied by a close-focused nose of pear, apricot and white flowers.

Spoon the olive oil over the fish until they are coated.  Place the onion on top of the fish. Cover the fish and refrigerate overnight to allow the fish to soak in the marinade.                            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).                            If baking the fish, transfer it to a 9x13 inch baking dish along with the olive oil, garlic, and onion. Sprinkle the fish with the cayenne or white pepper. If you are grilling the fish, wrap the fish and oil, garlic, onion, and pepper in aluminum foil.                            Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees F) for 30 minutes.
