Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The St. Michael-Eppan Anger Pinot Grigio with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 23 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":490914,"title":"St. Michael-Eppan Anger Pinot Grigio","description":"Depending on the soil and microclimate, Pinot gris varies from a simple everyday wine all the way up to absolute top growths. The warm, sun-exposed vineyards of the Anger sites, with their loamy limestone gravel soils, are a textbook example. The Anger Alto Adige Pinot Grigio has a noble structure, nice balance and fine acidity – making it an absolute pleasure to drink. The strong white goes well with fish and fish soup, guinea fowl breast or veal fillet.","price":"$22.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/490914-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":22.0,"score":0.8450746268656716,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fst-michael-eppan-anger-pinot-grigio-2018%2F535614"}]},"instructions":"Coat the fish fillets with the spice mixture, and allow to sit at room temperature for no longer than 30 minutes.Over high heat, add oil to skillet, and heat until hot.Cook fillets for about 3 minutes per side, or until fish is opaque and can be flaked with a fork.Remove from the pan.Pour pan juices over them and squeeze lemon juice all over.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Coat the fish fillets with the spice mixture, and allow to sit at room temperature for no longer than 30 minutes.Over high heat, add oil to skillet, and heat until hot.Cook fillets for about 3 minutes per side, or until fish is opaque and can be flaked with a fork.","ingredients":[{"id":10115261,"name":"fish fillets","localizedName":"fish fillets","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}],"length":{"number":33,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Remove from the pan.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Pour pan juices over them and squeeze lemon juice all over.","ingredients":[{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","localizedName":"lemon juice","image":"lemon-juice.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]}]}],"originalId":null}
