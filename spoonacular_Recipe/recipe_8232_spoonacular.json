To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. One wine you could try is Santan Ema Reserve Chardonnay. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 10 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":441028,"title":"Santa Ema Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Santa Ema Chardonnay Reserva is a bright golden yellow colored wine that comes from the Leyda Valley.
