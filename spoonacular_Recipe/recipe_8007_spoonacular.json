Try pairing with Merlot, Pinot Noir, and rosé Wine. Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. The Miranda Lambert County Road Merlot Wine with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 28 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428265,"title":"Miranda Lambert County Road Merlot Wine","description":"Our most robust spirit is full of fruity flavor and powerful color yet smooth in texture and delivery.

Remove the tuna steaks from the marinade, and press into the pea mixture to coat.  Pour the marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to medium, and simmer until the sauce has reduced and thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.                        While the sauce is cooking, sear the tuna in a small amount of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat to desired doneness.  Pour sauce over tuna to serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl, whisk together the five-spice powder, ginger, sake, rice vinegar, tamari, and sesame oil.","ingredients":[{"id":1022053,"name":"rice vinegar","localizedName":"rice vinegar","image":"rice-vinegar.png"},{"id":4058,"name":"sesame oil","localizedName":"sesame oil","image":"sesame-oil.png"},{"id":11216,"name":"ginger","localizedName":"ginger","image":"ginger.png"},{"id":10116124,"name":"tamari","localizedName":"tamari","image":"soy-sauce.jpg"},{"id":43479,"name":"sake","localizedName":"sake","image":"sake.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","localizedName":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the tuna steaks and turn to coat; allow to marinate for 30 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":0,"name":"tuna steak","localizedName":"tuna steak","image":"tuna-steak.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":30,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Combine the crushed wasabi peas and brown sugar.","ingredients":[{"id":19334,"name":"brown sugar","localizedName":"brown sugar","image":"dark-brown-sugar.png"},{"id":93719,"name":"wasabi peas","localizedName":"wasabi peas","image":"wasabi-peas.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Remove the tuna steaks from the marinade, and press into the pea mixture to coat.","ingredients":[{"id":0,"name":"tuna steak","localizedName":"tuna steak","image":"tuna-steak.png"},{"id":0,"name":"marinade","localizedName":"marinade","image":"seasoning.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Pour the marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.
