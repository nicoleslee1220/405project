The Zind-Humbrecht Calcaire Pinot Gris with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Superb smoky toasty nose, typical for this grape on limestone in Alsace (no new oak in our wines, just very long total lees contact). Some light reductive aromas that actually fit the style of dry Pinot-Gris. The palate is rich and creamy, with a velvety texture yet fully dry. It is an easy wine to drink now as there is no unnecessary weight. The finish is nice and round but fully dry. The complex limestone blend brings great acid balance and a certain weight. It should develop very nicely over the next few years.","price":"$45.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/467219-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8775000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fzind-humbrecht-calcaire-pinot-gris-2015%2F208573"}]},"instructions":"In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil. Add the shrimp shells and cook over moderate heat until they turn pink, 3 minutes. Add the onion, fennel, celery, smashed garlic and saffron and cook until softened, 5 minutes. Add the Pernod and brandy and cook until evaporated. Stir in the tomato paste, add 6 cups of water and bring to a boil. Simmer until the broth is reduced to 4 cups, 45 minutes. Add the tarragon and parsley sprigs and let stand off the heat for 15 minutes.                                              Strain the liquid, pressing the vegetables to mash them through the sieve. Alternatively, pass the mixture through a food mill. Discard the shrimp shells. Transfer the liquid to a saucepan and simmer until reduced to 2 cups, 30 minutes. Swirl in the butter and season with salt and pepper.                                              In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil until shimmering. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper, then saut over high heat, turning once, until nearly cooked, 2 minutes. Transfer the shrimp to a plate. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add the minced garlic and cook over low heat until softened and golden, 1 minute. Stir in the paprika. Return the shrimp to the skillet and add the chopped herbs and the lemon juice. Cook for 1 minute longer, until the shrimp are white throughout.                                              Ladle the sauce into bowls and top with the shrimp.
