Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. One wine you could try is Tinga Rio Reserve Merlot. It has 4.8 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 12 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":494870,"title":"Tinga Rio Reserve Merlot","description":"Ruby red in color with notes of raspberries and strawberries on the nose.

Drain and rinse thoroughly with cold water to stop the cooking process.                                                                                                 Melt butter in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add flour, and cook, whisking constantly, 1 minute. Slowly whisk in milk, and cook, whisking constantly, about 5 minutes or until mixture comes to a boil and thickens. Remove from heat, and slowly whisk in 1 cup Parmesan, whisking until smooth. Whisk in salt and pepper. Add noodles and green beans, parsley, tuna, capers, and, if desired, olives; gently toss to mix well. Add tomato, and gently toss to combine. Transfer mixture to an 11- x 7-inch (1 1/2-quart) baking dish coated with cooking spray.                                                                                                 Cover and refrigerate overnight, or sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan over casserole, and bake at 375 for 30 minutes or until bubbly and heated through.
