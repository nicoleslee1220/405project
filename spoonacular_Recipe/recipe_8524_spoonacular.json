After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Director's Merlot with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 21 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428445,"title":"Director's Merlot","description":"Our 2014 Director's Merlot offers lushness and a round, full palate. Its fragrance demonstrates red and black fruit with hints of anise and spiced wood. Juicy upon entry, the wine broadens and becomes velvety on the palate with flavors of plum, loganberry and black cherry accentuated by subtle spice notes of espresso bean and toasted vanilla. Medium tannins support the body of this wine, offering sophistication in its finish. Pairs nicely with brisket, grilled pork chops and linguine with pesto.","price":"$21.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428445-312x231.jpg","averageRating":1.0,"ratingCount":1.0,"score":0.75,"link":"https://www.amazon.com/2014-Directors-Merlot-750-mL/dp/B073XVS4MB?tag=spoonacular-20"}]},"instructions":"Bring the steaks to room temperature and season them on all sides with salt and pepper (dont be stingy with the salt!).                                   Heat the oven to 375 degrees and set a heavy ovenproof skillet (I like to use cast iron) over high heat. When the pan is hot, add the steaks and brown well on both sides, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the pan to the oven and continue to cook until the meat reaches desired doneness (it should take about 10 minutes for the internal temperature to reach 135 degrees, which is medium rare). Transfer the steaks to a plate and set in a warm place to rest, for at least 5, but preferably 10, minutes. Do NOT put the pan in the sink just yet!                                  Set the hot pan over low heat (make sure not to touch the handle and burn yourself!) and add about  cup water. Using a wooden spoon, scrape the bottom of the pan to get up all of the browned bits and stir to combine with the water. Set aside.                                  When you are ready to eat, slice the steaks across the grain into 1/3-inch slices. Reserve any juices that escape the meat. Arrange the arugula on a serving platter. Quarter the lemon. Drizzle a generous amount of good olive oil over the greens, followed by a generous squeeze of lemon juice, a liberal sprinkling of Maldon salt and several grinds of pepper. Lay the slices of steak on top of the greens, and then drizzle their juices and the fond from the pan over everything. Follow with another spritz of lemon and more pepper. Then use a vegetable peeler to top everything with a shower of parmesan curls. Serve immediately with leftover lemon wedges, roasted potatoes and a good Italian table wine.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Bring the steaks to room temperature and season them on all sides with salt and pepper (dont be stingy with the salt!).","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","localizedName":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":23232,"name":"steak","localizedName":"steak","image":"ribeye-raw.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat the oven to 375 degrees and set a heavy ovenproof skillet (I like to use cast iron) over high heat.
