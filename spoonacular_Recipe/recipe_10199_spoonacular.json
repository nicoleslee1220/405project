Buttery chardonnay is great for scallops, shrimp, crab, and lobster, while muscadet is a classic pick for mussels, oysters, and clams. If you've got some spice in your shellfish, a semi-dry riesling can balance out the heat. The Foley Johnson Carneros Chardonnay with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 23 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438603,"title":"Foley Johnson Carneros Chardonnay","description":"Aromas are concentrated and complex in our 2016 Carneros Chardonnay. Notes of grilled peach, pear, buttered croissant, and vanilla set the stage for a rich, and full-bodied Chardonnay. The aromas expand on the palate with mouthwatering flavors of pear, apple crisp, honeysuckle, toasted coconut, and vanilla wafer. This wineâ€™s balance and structure coupled with its bright acidity makes it an age-worthy wine to be enjoyed for several years.
