Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Thrive Pinot Grigio. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 15 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":488256,"title":"Thrive Pinot Grigio","description":"","price":"$14.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/488256-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9,"ratingCount":10.0,"score":0.867741935483871,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fthrive-pinot-grigio-2018%2F522678"}]},"instructions":"Preheat a grill for medium-high heat.
