Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Mark West Pinot Grigio with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":490366,"title":"Mark West Pinot Grigio","description":"Crisp and clean, this wine features honeydew, stone fruit, and citrus with a subtle, clean, lingering finish.\nTry pairing with good old fish and chips, summer salads, and steamed clams by the dozen...or dozens.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/490366-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9,"ratingCount":7.0,"score":0.8545454545454546,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fmark-west-pinot-grigio-2017%2F510897"}]},"instructions":"In a shallow bowl, combine the pine nuts, flour, dill, lemon-pepper and garlic salt.In another shallow bowl, combine the egg, lemon juice and honey.Dip the fish in egg-mixture, then coat with the nut mixture.In a nonstick skillet, cook fish in butter over medium heat for 4-6 minutes on each side or until the fish flakes easily with a fork.Sprinkle with dill.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a shallow bowl, combine the pine nuts, flour, dill, lemon-pepper and garlic salt.In another shallow bowl, combine the egg, lemon juice and honey.Dip the fish in egg-mixture, then coat with the nut mixture.In a nonstick skillet, cook fish in butter over medium heat for 4-6 minutes on each side or until the fish flakes easily with a fork.","ingredients":[{"id":1062047,"name":"garlic salt","localizedName":"garlic salt","image":"garlic-salt.jpg"},{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","localizedName":"lemon juice","image":"lemon-juice.jpg"},{"id":12147,"name":"pine nuts","localizedName":"pine nuts","image":"pine-nuts.png"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","localizedName":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","localizedName":"pepper","image":"pepper.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","localizedName":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":19296,"name":"honey","localizedName":"honey","image":"honey.png"},{"id":9150,"name":"lemon","localizedName":"lemon","image":"lemon.png"},{"id":2045,"name":"dill","localizedName":"dill","image":"dill.jpg"},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"dip","localizedName":"dip","image":""},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","localizedName":"egg","image":"egg.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}],"length":{"number":6,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Sprinkle with dill.","ingredients":[{"id":2045,"name":"dill","localizedName":"dill","image":"dill.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]}],"originalId":null}
