Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr체ner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Skyfall Pinot Gris. It has 4.7 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 13 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":445128,"title":"Skyfall Pinot Gris","description":"Pale straw in color with notes of mango, citrus blossom and banana in the nose.

Using a small, sharp knife, peel the lemon, removing all the bitter white pith. Cut the lemon into 1/4-inch dice, discarding the seeds. Transfer the diced lemon to a medium bowl and add the tomatoes, cucumber, shallot, thyme and chives. Stir in the 1/4 cup of olive oil and season with salt and pepper.                                              Lay two 20-inch-square sheets of heavy-duty foil on top of each other, then fold them in half to form a rectangle. Fold up 2 inches on each side, neatly folding in the corners to form a low-sided box. Brush the foil with olive oil and set the fish on the foil. Season with salt and pepper and spoon 1/3 cup of the vinaigrette on each fillet. Using 2 long spatulas, set the foil package on a medium-hot grill and cook for about 15 minutes, or until the fish is just cooked through. Alternatively, roast the foil package on a cookie sheet in the oven for about 20 minutes. Transfer to a platter and serve with Braised Endives.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Light a grill or preheat the oven to 50","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404706,"name":"grill","localizedName":"grill","image":"grill.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Using a small, sharp knife, peel the lemon, removing all the bitter white pith.","ingredients":[{"id":9150,"name":"lemon","localizedName":"lemon","image":"lemon.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404745,"name":"knife","localizedName":"knife","image":"chefs-knife.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Cut the lemon into 1/4-inch dice, discarding the seeds.","ingredients":[{"id":9150,"name":"lemon","localizedName":"lemon","image":"lemon.png"},{"id":93818,"name":"seeds","localizedName":"seeds","image":"sunflower-seeds.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Transfer the diced lemon to a medium bowl and add the tomatoes, cucumber, shallot, thyme and chives.
