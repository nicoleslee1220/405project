Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The St. Michael-Eppan Anger Pinot Grigio with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 23 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":490914,"title":"St. Michael-Eppan Anger Pinot Grigio","description":"Depending on the soil and microclimate, Pinot gris varies from a simple everyday wine all the way up to absolute top growths. The warm, sun-exposed vineyards of the Anger sites, with their loamy limestone gravel soils, are a textbook example. The Anger Alto Adige Pinot Grigio has a noble structure, nice balance and fine acidity – making it an absolute pleasure to drink. The strong white goes well with fish and fish soup, guinea fowl breast or veal fillet.","price":"$22.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/490914-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":22.0,"score":0.8450746268656716,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fst-michael-eppan-anger-pinot-grigio-2018%2F535614"}]},"instructions":"For the chutney (prep time includes marinating chutney, you can make the night before), mix all ingredients and allow flavors to mingle for about 3 hours- if you are in a pinch, it's fine to marinate it for less time.Rinse fillets and pat dry-- make sure they are not slippery at all.Preheat oven to 375F.Put olive oil in the bottom of a baking dish, tilt to coat bottom.Combine ginger garlic paste with tumeric, chili powder, cumin and salt and rub this all over the fillets on both sides.Take each fillet and place about 3 tablespoons of chutney near the wide end and roll it up.Place fillet rolls seam side down in the oiled dish.Bake in preheated oven.Fish are done when they flake with a fork, about 30 minutes (watch closely; if your fillets are a little smaller or they are rolled a little bigger, the cooking time will vary).Serves 4- 8, depending on the size of your fillets- we serve 2 per person.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the chutney (prep time includes marinating chutney, you can make the night before), mix all ingredients and allow flavors to mingle for about 3 hours- if you are in a pinch, it's fine to marinate it for less time.Rinse fillets and pat dry-- make sure they are not slippery at all.Preheat oven to 375F.Put olive oil in the bottom of a baking dish, tilt to coat bottom.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"chutney","localizedName":"chutney","image":""}],"equipment":[{"id":404646,"name":"baking pan","localizedName":"baking pan","image":"roasting-pan.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":375.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}],"length":{"number":180,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Combine ginger garlic paste with tumeric, chili powder, cumin and salt and rub this all over the fillets on both sides.Take each fillet and place about 3 tablespoons of chutney near the wide end and roll it up.","ingredients":[{"id":10093754,"name":"ginger garlic paste","localizedName":"ginger garlic paste","image":"ginger-garlic-paste.png"},{"id":2009,"name":"chili powder","localizedName":"chili powder","image":"chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"chutney","localizedName":"chutney","image":""},{"id":2043,"name":"turmeric","localizedName":"turmeric","image":"turmeric.jpg"},{"id":1002014,"name":"cumin","localizedName":"cumin","image":"ground-cumin.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"roll","localizedName":"roll","image":"dinner-yeast-rolls.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":1012034,"name":"dry seasoning rub","localizedName":"dry seasoning rub","image":"seasoning.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Place fillet rolls seam side down in the oiled dish.","ingredients":[{"id":0,"name":"roll","localizedName":"roll","image":"dinner-yeast-rolls.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Bake in preheated oven.Fish are done when they flake with a fork, about 30 minutes (watch closely; if your fillets are a little smaller or they are rolled a little bigger, the cooking time will vary).","ingredients":[{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}],"length":{"number":30,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":5,"step":"Serves 4- 8, depending on the size of your fillets- we serve 2 per person.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]}]}],"originalId":null}
