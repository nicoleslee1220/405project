Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Maysaran Arsheen Pinot Gris. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":476600,"title":"Maysara Arsheen Pinot Gris","description":"A bright expression of fruit right up front, greeting your palate with notes of cut grass on a warm day.

Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and let simmer until reduced to a thick glaze. Stir in the black bean sauce, if using.    Heat the grill, making sure its clean. The coals should be medium hot. Baste the inside of the fish with some of the soy glaze; reserve the extra glaze. Layer the cilantro, garlic, and ginger in the belly cavity of the fish; season with salt and pepper. Wrapthree orfour pieces of kitchen twine around the fish; knot each piece tightly and trim any excess twine. Brush the outside of the fish with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.    Cook on a medium-hot grill, turning once, until cooked through, about 10 minutes per side. Liberally baste the grilled fish with the reserved soy glaze before serving.    Drink Suggestions          The soy-glazed snapper, with its sweetness and spice, would pair well with off-dry whites, such as Gewrtztraminer and Riesling. Try the fruity Traminer Riesling blend from Rosemount of Australia.                      nutrition information (per serving):        Calories                        (kcal):                      490, Fat                        (kcal):                      19, Fat Calories                        (g):                      170, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      3, Protein                        (g):                      50, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      7, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      25, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      7, Sodium                        (g):                      2700, Cholesterol                        (g):                      85, Fiber                        (g):                      1,                     Photo: Philippe Houz          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the glaze, combine the soy sauce, sake, honey, ginger, garlic, mustard, and sesame oil in a small saucepan.
