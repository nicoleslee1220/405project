Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. You could try Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Merlot.

Add the oils in a slow stream, whisking vigorously, to form a light emulsion. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and set aside.                                                     Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. Cut the stem core out of the top of the tomatoes and cut an X in the bottom. Plunge the tomatoes into the boiling water for 15-20 seconds, then rinse under cold water. The peel can now be removed easily. Slice the tomatoes in half crosswise and remove the seeds and pulp.                                                     Put the tomatoes, garlic, thyme, salt and pepper to taste, and the vinaigrette into a food processor or blender and process until well blended. Thin with a little vinegar if necessary.                                                     Allow the tuna fillets to stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Season all sides with salt and pepper.                                                     Heat the 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large, heavy skillet until almost smoking. Place 4 tuna blocks at a time in the pan and cook over high heat for about 20 seconds per side, until all sides are lightly browned. Repeat until all of the tuna is cooked, adding more olive oil if necessary.                                                     Toss the arugula or spring mix with enough vinaigrette to coat and arrange in the center of the plate. Place tuna around the salad and drizzle with more of the vinaigrette.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                var articleType_27_data = {};                    articleType_27_data.init_step_by_step_images = 0;","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"To make the vinaigrette","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Whisk the lemon juice, vinegar, and mustard together in a bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","localizedName":"lemon juice","image":"lemon-juice.jpg"},{"id":2046,"name":"mustard","localizedName":"mustard","image":"regular-mustard.jpg"},{"id":2053,"name":"vinegar","localizedName":"vinegar","image":"vinegar-(white).jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","localizedName":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the oils in a slow stream, whisking vigorously, to form a light emulsion.
