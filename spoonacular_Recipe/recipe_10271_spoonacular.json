Try pairing with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. You could try Aubert Lauren Vineyard Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 139 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":441715,"title":"Aubert Lauren Vineyard Chardonnay","description":"The 2011 Lauren Estate Chardonnay always reminds one of a hypothetical vintage blend of Sonoma Coast meets White Burgundy. This 2011 Lauren is naturally clear with green chlorophyll tints on edge. Aromatics are classic Lauren with nuances of lemon-mineral, dried pear and even some green tea-like tones. The pronounced aromatics of fruits and minerals give an organic sense of place. The bouquet is multi-faceted with hints of apple-baked goods and wet stones. The mouth feel presents a glycerin top note, followed by an acid structure only found at Lauren.The wine has a slight hazy clarity showing Aubert's commitment to minimal interventional winemaking.","price":"$139.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/441715-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8175000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Faubert-lauren-vineyard-chardonnay-2011%2F122070"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"originalId":null}
