Halve 1 of the onions. Add the carrots, the onion halves, celery, garlic cloves, bay leaves, and peppercorns and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Decrease the heat to medium and simmer gently for 2 hours, skimming off any scum that rises to the top. Remove the chicken from the broth and let rest in a large dish until it is cool enough to handle. Strain the chicken broth and return it to the stockpot. Youâ€™ll have 10 to 12 cups of broth. Remove the skin from the cooled chicken and discard; shred the meat and return it to the broth in the stockpot.                                                                Heat the oil in a large skillet set over medium heat. Cut the remaining onion into 1/4-inch dice. SautÃ© the diced onion, minced garlic, poblano, and corn for about 3 minutes until the vegetables are soft. Stir the sautÃ©ed vegetables into the chicken stock, stir in the salt, oregano, and lime juice and bring the mixture to a simmer. Taste and add more salt and lime juice if needed. Serve hot with the toppings of your choice.                                                            do it early                The soup can be made up to 2 days in advance, covered, and refrigerated.
