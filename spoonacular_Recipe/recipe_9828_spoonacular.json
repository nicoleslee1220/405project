After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. One wine you could try is Miranda Lambert County Road Merlot Wine. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 28 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428265,"title":"Miranda Lambert County Road Merlot Wine","description":"Our most robust spirit is full of fruity flavor and powerful color yet smooth in texture and delivery.
