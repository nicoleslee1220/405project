Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"1. Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Cut the yellow and red tomatoes in half. Gently squeeze each tomato half to drain the juice and seeds. Lay tomatoes in a single layer on parchment lined baking sheets and allow to dry out in the oven for 2 hours. (You can skip the tomatoes for a quick weeknight meal or make them ahead. They will stay good covered in olive oil in an airtight container stored in the fridge for up to a month!)2. Cook pasta according to directions. Drain, saving some of the cooking water, but do not rinse the pasta.3. Add almonds and cheese to a food process or blender. Process at very slow speed until combined. Add arugula and garlic, then olive oil, salt and pepper. Process the mixture slowly the entire time to ensure that the blade doesnt heat up too much (which would cook the greens and cheese proteins, changing the flavor) and also that they mixture doesnt become overly smooth.4. Add pasta and pesto to a large bowl and toss to coat well. Dont be afraid to add a ladle or two of cooking water, if necessary to create a creamy texture. You can also add oil and cheese to taste. Toss in oven dried tomatoes, if using and toss one more time. Serve garnished with toasted sliced almonds.*Note: The most recent guidelines released by the American Academy of Pediatrics indicates no proven benefit in delaying solids, even high allergen foods including nuts, beyond 4- to 6-months.
