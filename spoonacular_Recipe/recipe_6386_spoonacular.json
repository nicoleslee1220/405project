Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Rabble Pinot Gris. It has 4.9 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 20 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":452031,"title":"Rabble Pinot Gris","description":"Alsatian-inspired with notes of lime, green apple, white flower and wetstone.
