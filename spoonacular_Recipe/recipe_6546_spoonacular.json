Whisk together fennel and 1 cup yogurt with garlic, ginger, cumin, coriander, black pepper, turmeric, cayenne, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Coat fish with yogurt mixture and marinate in a shallow baking dish, covered and chilled, 1 hour.                                                                            While fish is marinating, whisk together remaining cup yogurt, mint, zest, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt to make sauce.                                                                            Prepare grill for cooking. If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. Charcoal is medium-hot when you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 3 to 4 seconds. If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then reduce heat to moderate.                                                                            Lift fish out of marinade, letting excess drip off (discard marinade), and grill fish, covered only if using a gas grill, on lightly oiled grill rack, turning over once, until just cooked through, about 12 minutes total. (If using halibut, grill skin sides down first and grill, turning once, 8 to 9 minutes total.) Serve fish with sauce.                                    Cooks' note:If you aren't able to grill outdoors, sturgeon can be grilled in a well-seasoned large ridged grill pan (without crowding) over moderately high heat, turning once, until just cooked through, about 12 minutes total.
