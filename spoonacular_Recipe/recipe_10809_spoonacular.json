After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Merlot with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":2043776,"title":"Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Merlot","description":"The wine's multi-dimensional flavors come from grapes grown in distinctly different terroirs of Napa Valley, including the Carneros, Stags Leap and Oakville districts. Traditional techniques, including native yeasts, extended maceration, aging in French oak barrels and bottling without filtration, enhanced the wine's complexity. This wine is delicious with many entrees and cheeses. One of our favorite food pairings is roast turkey with a wild mushroom and walnut stuffing. Roast leg of lamb, rubbed with fragrant herbs and spices, or grilled pork loin also marry perfectly with the wine's luscious flavors.","price":"$19.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/2043776-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":10.0,"score":0.827741935483871,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Frobert-mondavi-napa-valley-merlot-2003%2F85929"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"originalId":null}
