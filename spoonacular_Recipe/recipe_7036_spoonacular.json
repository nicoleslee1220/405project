Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Zind-Humbrecht Clos Windsbuhl Vendange Tardive Pinot Gris with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.
