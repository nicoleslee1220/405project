To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The A to Z Chardonnay with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 15 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":444065,"title":"A to Z Chardonnay","description":"The 2010 A to Z Chardonnay opens with aromas of white flowers, tangerine, lime, quince, wet stone and minerals that develop further into nutmeg, honey, green apple with hints of ginger. A mineral laden attack is bright, mouthwatering and intense. The nuanced mid-palate carries on with flavors that mirror and amplify the aromatics. The finish is long, clean, crisp and juicy with flavors of honeysuckle, citrus and wet stone. This wine exemplifies classic Oregon steely Chardonnay. 2010 was an exceptional vintage for white wines in Oregon and this sophisticated terroir driven wine is no exception; bright, tangy and intense it will deliver over the next 5 years.","price":"$14.95","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/444065-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8400000000000001,"ratingCount":7.0,"score":0.7945454545454547,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fa-to-z-chardonnay-2010%2F117168"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"sourceName":null,"creditsText":null,"originalId":null}
