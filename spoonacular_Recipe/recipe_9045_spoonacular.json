Heat oil in a heavy skillet over moderately high heat until just beginning to smoke, then brown beef on all sides, about 2 minutes total.

Roast beef in middle of oven until a thermometer inserted 2 inches into thickest part of meat registers 125°F for medium-rare, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let stand until cool, at least 45 minutes.                                                            Prepare salad while beef is roasting:                Chill onion slices in water to cover 30 minutes. Cook beans in boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Drain beans in a colander and rinse under cold water to stop cooking, then transfer to a large bowl. Add arugula to beans. Drain onion slices and pat dry.                                                            Make dressing and toss salad:                Whisk together vinegar, lemon juice, mustard, and salt and pepper to taste. Add oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified.
