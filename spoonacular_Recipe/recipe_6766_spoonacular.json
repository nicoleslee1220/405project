Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Mark West Pinot Grigio. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 13 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":490366,"title":"Mark West Pinot Grigio","description":"Crisp and clean, this wine features honeydew, stone fruit, and citrus with a subtle, clean, lingering finish.\nTry pairing with good old fish and chips, summer salads, and steamed clams by the dozen...or dozens.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/490366-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9,"ratingCount":7.0,"score":0.8545454545454546,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fmark-west-pinot-grigio-2017%2F510897"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 375F.
