Using a sharp knife, or one with a sharp serrated edge, cut through the shell along the top (back?) of the shrimp so that you cut halfway through the shrimp from the head down to the tail. This will let the marinade get in and flavor the shrimp better. Add the butterflied shrimp to the marinade.4Put on the lid, or a healthy few layers of plastic wrap and shake to get all the shrimp covered. Return to the fridge or better, on a bed of ice, for about 15 to 20 minutes.5For best results, put the shrimp on a skewer.
