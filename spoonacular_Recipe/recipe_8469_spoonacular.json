At low speed, stir in half of the warm water, the olive oil and the salt, then add the remaining water and mix until a ball forms. Mix the dough for 2 minutes at low speed, 2 minutes at medium speed and 2 final minutes at low speed. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place until the dough has doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.                                                        Put a pizza stone in the bottom of the oven and preheat the stone in the oven to 500 for about 45 minutes.                                              Punch down the dough and scrape it onto a floured work surface. Form the dough into a ball. Cut the ball into 8 equal-size pieces. Knead each piece into a ball and then flatten into disks. Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for about 20 minutes.                                              Put the sun-dried tomatoes in a small saucepan and cover with water. Cover and simmer over low heat until very soft, about 5 minutes. Drain and coarsely chop the tomatoes. In a mini food processor, puree the chopped garlic with the olive oil.                                              Generously flour a pizza peel. Using a rolling pin, roll out a disk of dough to an 8-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. (Alternatively, pull and stretch the disk into an 8-inch round.) Transfer the round to the peel and brush with the garlic puree. Scatter with one-eighth of the sun-dried tomatoes and arrange one-eighth of the sliced cheese on top. Drizzle with a little of the garlic puree and season with salt and pepper. Bake on the hot stone for about 4 minutes, until the crust is crisp and the cheese is bubbling. Top with some baby arugula and serve. Repeat with the remaining dough and toppings.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the dough hook, mix the flour, sugar and yeast at medium speed.
