Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine.

Coat the tuna with the oil and season lightly with salt and pepper. Set a 10-inch heavy-duty skillet over high heat. When the pan is very hot, after 2 to 3 minutes, sear the tuna logs for 20 to 30 seconds on each side-they should be seared outside and rare inside. Transfer to a clean cutting board and slice 1/4 inch thick.    In a -medium bowl, combine the pineapple, scallions, lime juice, soy sauce, and ginger. Add the avocado and gently stir to combine. Stir in the chopped cilantro.    To assemble, set the tuna slices on rice crackers; top each with a small spoonful of the salsa and a whole cilantro leaf. You may have extra crackers and salsa.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Size                        :                      per piece based on 48 pieces, Calories                        (kcal):                      25, Fat                        (kcal):                      1, Fat Calories                        (g):                      10, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      0, Protein                        (g):                      1, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      1, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      3, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      0, Sodium                        (g):                      150, Cholesterol                        (g):                      4.5, Fiber                        (g):                      0,                     Photo: Scott Phillips          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut the tuna into long, fat, squared-off strips or \"logs\" 1 to 1-1/2 inches thick.
