Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try St. Michael-Eppan Anger Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 23 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":490914,"title":"St. Michael-Eppan Anger Pinot Grigio","description":"Depending on the soil and microclimate, Pinot gris varies from a simple everyday wine all the way up to absolute top growths. The warm, sun-exposed vineyards of the Anger sites, with their loamy limestone gravel soils, are a textbook example. The Anger Alto Adige Pinot Grigio has a noble structure, nice balance and fine acidity – making it an absolute pleasure to drink. The strong white goes well with fish and fish soup, guinea fowl breast or veal fillet.","price":"$22.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/490914-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":22.0,"score":0.8450746268656716,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fst-michael-eppan-anger-pinot-grigio-2018%2F535614"}]},"instructions":"Combine juice, zest, oil, paste, garlic, salt, sugar, and pepper.Marinate fish for at least 3 hours.Broil for 5-7 minutes on each side.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine juice, zest, oil, paste, garlic, salt, sugar, and pepper.Marinate fish for at least 3 hours.Broil for 5-7 minutes on each side.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","localizedName":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","localizedName":"pepper","image":"pepper.jpg"},{"id":1019016,"name":"juice","localizedName":"juice","image":"apple-juice.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","localizedName":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":187,"unit":"minutes"}}]}],"originalId":null}
