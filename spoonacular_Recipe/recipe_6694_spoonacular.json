Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Maysaran Arsheen Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":476600,"title":"Maysara Arsheen Pinot Gris","description":"A bright expression of fruit right up front, greeting your palate with notes of cut grass on a warm day.

If using a grill, reverse this.    Heat the broiler with the rack as close to the heat source as possible, or heat a gas grill, covered, to high.    Arrange the fish steaks in a 9x13-inch nonreactivedish. Combine the oil, minced garlic, chile flakes, half of the parsley, the lemon juice, and a generous amount of pepper. Pour this mixture over the fish and use your fingers to coat the steaks with it.    Melt the butter in a 12-inch nonreactive skillet over medium heat and, when hot and bubbling, reduce the heat to medium low. Cook the butter gently, until the milk solids begin to turn light golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add the sliced garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until it turns golden, another 2 to 3 minutes; dont let the garlic or butter solids burn. Stir in the peppers and capers and then move the pan to a cold burner.    Sprinkle both sides of the fish with salt and put the fish steaks either on a cold broiler pan or on the hot grill. Broil or grill the fish, turning once, until golden on both sides and cooked through but still succulent, about 10 minutes total. Transfer the fish to a warmed serving platter.    Reheat the sauce over medium heat until its sizzling. Stir in the balsamic vinegar, the remaining parsley, and black pepper to taste. When hot, spoon this mixture on top of the fish and serve immediately.    Variations    Halibut steaks make a fine substitute for the swordfish.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Calories                        (kcal):                      540, Fat                        (kcal):                      41, Fat Calories                        (g):                      370, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      15, Protein                        (g):                      31, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      21, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      9, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      4, Sodium                        (g):                      820, Cholesterol                        (g):                      105, Fiber                        (g):                      1,               Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Tip:If using a broiler, cook the fish for 4 minutes on the first side and for 6 minutes after turning.
