Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Jean Biecher Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":2045398,"title":"Jean Biecher Pinot Gris","description":"This Pinot Gris has a beautiful yellow-gold color. Rich in aromatic complexity, Pinot Gris can reveal typically smoky notes as well as delicious aromas of dried fruit, apricot, honey, beeswax and gingerbread. This ample and fleshy wine is sustained by a delightful tension which gives the wine a full-bodied structure. The finish is long and well balanced.ave a noble, velvety texture sometimes with smooth and silky nuances.\nWith its richness of expression, Pinot Gris sports a natural audacity, able to be matched with dishes usually for red wines. With its hint of earthy and smoky undergrowth, Pinot Gris d’Alsace makes an admirable match for pan-fried girolle mushrooms, risotto with boletus mushrooms.","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/2045398-312x231.jpg","averageRating":1.0,"ratingCount":8.0,"score":0.96,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fjean-biecher-pinot-gris-2020%2F759987"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"sourceName":null,"creditsText":null,"originalId":null}
