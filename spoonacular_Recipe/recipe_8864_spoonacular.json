Place on a baking sheet and bake until lightly browned and just crisp on the outside, about 10 minutes.Combine the vinegars, 1/4 tsp. salt, and a pinch of pepper in a large bowl and slowly whisk in the olive oil. Add the bread cubes, peppers, olives, and artichokes and toss to coat with the vinaigrette. Set aside to marinate for 10-15 minutes. Just before serving, toss in the arugula and cheese and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. (The salad, without the arugula and cheese, can be made up to 8 hours in advance. Store in the fridge but eat the salad at room temperature).Simple Artichoke SaladMakes about 3 cupsIf you are going to use frozen artichokes, I would add them, unthawed, to the poaching liquid as described below.2 pounds small artichokes, trimmed2 1/2 cups water1/4 cup olive oil1/4 cup white wine3 tbsp. lemon juice1 tbsp. Champagne vinegar2 garlic cloves, smashed with the flat side of a knife, skin left on3 fresh thyme sprigs1 bay leaf1 tsp. saltPinch of pepperCombine everything except the artichokes in a wide non-reactive pan and bring to a boil. Drop in the artichokes and cover the surface with parchment paper or an heat-proof inverted plate to keep the artichokes submerged. Bring the liquid back to a boil, lower the heat and simmer until tender, 10-15 minutes depending on their size. To test whether they are done, stick the tip of a knife into the base and the leaves, make sure both are tender.Once done, drain the artichokes and toss them with:1/2 tbsp. olive oil1/2 tsp. minced garlic1/2 tsp. grated lemon zestsalt and pepper to tasteOne last note: To make sure the artichokes are done, I would taste one. You want to be able to easily bite through (and swallow the leaves).
