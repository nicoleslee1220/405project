Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like ahi tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your ahi tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. One wine you could try is Goldschmidt Vineyard Alexander Valley Chelsea Merlot. It has 4.8 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 20 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":503936,"title":"Goldschmidt Vineyard Alexander Valley Chelsea Merlot","description":"Beautiful red raspberry, black cherry, and spice aromas.

Use your judgment on what shape you want to cut your tuna because not all tuna is the same size or shape.  However, the shape should somewhat resemble a miniature brick.                        Season the tuna pieces with salt and pepper. Coat lightly on all sides with bread crumbs. Heat olive oil in a large heavy skillet over high heat. The pan should be as hot as you can get it. Place the tuna in the pan, and sear on each side for about 45 seconds for small portions, or 1 minute for large. Remove from pan. The tuna will be very rare.
