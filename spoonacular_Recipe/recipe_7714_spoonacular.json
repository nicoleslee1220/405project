Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. You could try Enate Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot.

A complex blackcurrant, blackberry aroma with a touch of violet and hints of red pepper, vanilla and herbs.

Brush tuna steaks with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Place in the hot skillet, and sear for 3 to 5 minutes on each side.
