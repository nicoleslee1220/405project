An exquisite expression of the Sangiovese grape, with substantial acidity from the low pH of the soil in this region.The aromas of this complex red wine range from cherries and plums to gladiolus flowers and earthy flint. The tannic, oak-aged flavors are bright and round, with a dry, warm, earthy finish.Best enjoyed with very flavorful dishes, such as tomato-based sauces, mushroom ravioli, beef or pork roasts, and game meats from venison to pheasant. It is also excellent with mature cheeses.Blend: 85% Sangiovese, 15% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon","price":"$26.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/436659-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.96,"ratingCount":8.0,"score":0.9199999999999999,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fsanta-margherita-chianti-classico-riserva-2013%2F167314"}]},"instructions":"Prepare pasta according to package directions.Heat sauce and crabmeat in medium saucepan until hot; add pasta, heat through.Top with cheese.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare pasta according to package directions.","ingredients":[{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","localizedName":"pasta","image":"fusilli.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat sauce and crabmeat in medium saucepan until hot; add pasta, heat through.Top with cheese.","ingredients":[{"id":10015136,"name":"crabmeat","localizedName":"crabmeat","image":"crabmeat.jpg"},{"id":1041009,"name":"cheese","localizedName":"cheese","image":"cheddar-cheese.png"},{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","localizedName":"pasta","image":"fusilli.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"sauce","localizedName":"sauce","image":""}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","localizedName":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}]}]}],"originalId":null}
