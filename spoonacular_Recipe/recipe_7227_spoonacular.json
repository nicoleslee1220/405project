Sprinkle inside of each trout with salt (use about 1/2 tsp. total). Stuff each with a single layer of smoked salmon, dividing evenly. In a large, shallow dish, combine cornmeal and remaining 1/2 tsp. salt. Turn fish in cornmeal to coat evenly.                                                                                                 Pour 2 tbsp. oil into each of two 12-in. frying pans, preferably nonstick, and warm them over medium heat. (Or warm a large griddle over 2 burners.) Put 3 fish in each pan and saut, turning once, until golden brown outside and no longer translucent in the center, 8 to 9 minutes total; reduce heat if fish start to get too brown. Transfer fish to 1 or 2 large platters and keep warm in oven. Repeat cooking in 1 pan with 1 to 2 more tbsp. oil and remaining fish.                                                                                                 Pour 1 more tbsp. oil into 1 pan (or onto griddle) if it's dry, then set over medium-high heat. Quickly saut peppers until they're softened and lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
