Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Jean Biecher Pinot Gris with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":2045398,"title":"Jean Biecher Pinot Gris","description":"This Pinot Gris has a beautiful yellow-gold color.

The finish is long and well balanced.ave a noble, velvety texture sometimes with smooth and silky nuances.\nWith its richness of expression, Pinot Gris sports a natural audacity, able to be matched with dishes usually for red wines.
