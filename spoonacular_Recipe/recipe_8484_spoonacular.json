After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Director's Merlot with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 21 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428445,"title":"Director's Merlot","description":"Our 2014 Director's Merlot offers lushness and a round, full palate. Its fragrance demonstrates red and black fruit with hints of anise and spiced wood. Juicy upon entry, the wine broadens and becomes velvety on the palate with flavors of plum, loganberry and black cherry accentuated by subtle spice notes of espresso bean and toasted vanilla. Medium tannins support the body of this wine, offering sophistication in its finish. Pairs nicely with brisket, grilled pork chops and linguine with pesto.","price":"$21.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428445-312x231.jpg","averageRating":1.0,"ratingCount":1.0,"score":0.75,"link":"https://www.amazon.com/2014-Directors-Merlot-750-mL/dp/B073XVS4MB?tag=spoonacular-20"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 400. In a small saucepan, combine 1/2 cup of the olive oil with the chopped rosemary and bring to a simmer over moderate heat. Remove from the heat and let stand for 10 minutes. Strain the oil through a fine sieve and let cool completely; reserve 1/2 teaspoon of the rosemary. Whisk the balsamic vinegar into the oil and season with salt and pepper.                                              In a medium ovenproof skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil until shimmering. Season the steak with salt and pepper and cook over high heat until well browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Turn the steak, transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for about 8 minutes for medium-rare meat. Transfer the steak to a carving board and let rest for 5 minutes.                                              Toss the arugula with 1 tablespoon of the rosemary vinaigrette and mound the salad on 2 dinner plates. Thinly slice the steak crosswise and arrange it over the arugula. Sprinkle each serving with 1/4 teaspoon of rosemary and then drizzle with 1 teaspoon of the rosemary vinaigrette. Refrigerate the remaining vinaigrette for another use. Serve with lemon wedges.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 40","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"In a small saucepan, combine 1/2 cup of the olive oil with the chopped rosemary and bring to a simmer over moderate heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":2036,"name":"rosemary","localizedName":"rosemary","image":"rosemary.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","localizedName":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Remove from the heat and let stand for 10 minutes.
