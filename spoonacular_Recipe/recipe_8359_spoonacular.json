Drain the bacon on paper towels or on a brown paper bag.Keep the pan hot and make sure there are about 6 tablespoons of bacon fat in the pan.

Add a few turns of the pepper mill's worth of fresh black pepper.The salad can be served now, with the ingredients still warm, or at room temperature. To assemble: In a large bowl, toss the dressing with the squash and bacon. Add several large handfuls of the arugula.
