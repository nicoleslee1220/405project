To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. One wine you could try is La Crema Russian River Chardonnay. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 28 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":435904,"title":"La Crema Russian River Chardonnay","description":"On the nose are citrus tones, with green apple, pineapple and floral aromas accentuated by caramel and hazelnut traces.
