Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Nickel & Nickel Harris Vineyard Merlot with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Sprinkle ribs lightly all over with salt and pepper, and place in a single layer, bones down, in a 12-by 17-inch roasting pan. Bake in a 450 regular or convection oven until meat is beginning to brown, 15 to 20 minutes. With tongs, turn ribs. Add onion, carrots, celery, and ginger to pan around ribs, then mix to coat with fat in pan, and spread level. Bake until ribs are well browned and vegetables are beginning to brown, 15 to 20 minutes longer.                                                                                                 Meanwhile, wrap peppercorns, star anise, cinnamon stick, and 2 rosemary sprigs in a double layer of cheesecloth, 10 inches square; tie closed with heavy cotton string. To pan, add broth, tangerine juice, port, and spice bundle. Stir gently to mix and scrape browned bits free. Cover pan tightly with foil.                                                                                                 Bake in a 325 regular or convection oven until meat is very tender when pierced, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Uncover pan and discard spice bundle. With tongs, transfer ribs to a rimmed platter; cover and keep warm in a 200 oven. Skim and discard fat from pan juices. Boil over high heat, stirring often, until reduced to 2 1/2 cups, about 10 minutes. Add tangerine slices and cook just until heated through, about 1 minute.
