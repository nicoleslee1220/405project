Whisk in 13 Tbsp. cool water and oil until blended, thick and foamy. Set batter aside.                                                                                                Pour oil to about 1 1/2 inches deep in a large, deep skillet. Heat oil to 375F. Meanwhile, break up any lumps of coconut and spread out on a baking sheet lined with wax paper. Pat shrimp dry with paper towels. Dip shrimp, one at a time, into batter to coat completely; shake off excess and place on top of coconut. Roll each shrimp in coconut to coat; shake off excess and transfer to a wire rack.                                                                                                Slip shrimp into hot oil, 6 to 8 at a time, and cook for about 1 minute, or until golden brown and crisp; regulate heat to keep temperature at 375F. Transfer shrimp with a mesh skimmer, slotted spoon or tongs to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain. Repeat with remaining shrimp, keeping oil as clear as possible by scooping out debris with skimmer or a small strainer. Transfer shrimp to a serving platter and serve hot with cocktail sauce on the side.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt and cayenne.","ingredients":[{"id":18369,"name":"baking powder","localizedName":"baking powder","image":"white-powder.jpg"},{"id":20027,"name":"corn starch","localizedName":"corn starch","image":"white-powder.jpg"},{"id":2031,"name":"ground cayenne pepper","localizedName":"ground cayenne pepper","image":"chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","localizedName":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","localizedName":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Whisk in 13 Tbsp. cool water and oil until blended, thick and foamy.
