Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. You could try Enate Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.8 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":2049876,"title":"Enate Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot","description":"Fully ruby color. A complex blackcurrant, blackberry aroma with a touch of violet and hints of red pepper, vanilla and herbs. Smooth and round mouthfeel; the soft tannic cushion gives way to a flavorsome palate which releases pleasant honey-roast aromas.
