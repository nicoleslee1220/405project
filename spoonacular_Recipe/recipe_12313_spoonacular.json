An explosion of lively green apple, citrus and salty baking spices. Floral notes of jasmine and ginger are there with a sense of depth. The wine evolves as the effervescents keep the aromatics of this wine in a constant evolution. The zero-dosage element of this wine has it dancing on the palate from start to finish. It’s alive with an array of citrus, mineral, and spice. Upfront, it’s almost sensory overload but when you come back down to earth citrus, brine and stone fruit settle in with an exotic fruit element that leaves you to sit back and take in its rewarding evolution. This is a micro production wine that is sure to keep the sense in a deep state of satisfying intrigue.","price":"$35.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/496862-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8175000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fcadre-ode-to-pearls-sparkling-albarino-2017%2F650292"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"originalId":null}
