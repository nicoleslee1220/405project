Try pairing with Merlot, Pinot Noir, and rosé Wine. Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. One wine you could try is Robert Mondavi Napa Merlot. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 30 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":438573,"title":"Robert Mondavi Napa Merlot","description":"The wine's multi-dimensional flavors come from grapes grown in distinctly different terroirs of Napa Valley, including the Carneros, Stags Leap and Oakville districts. Traditional techniques, including native yeasts, extended maceration, aging in French oak barrels and bottling without filtration, enhanced the wine's complexity. This wine is delicious with many entrees and cheeses. One of our favorite food pairings is roast turkey with a wild mushroom and walnut stuffing. Roast leg of lamb, rubbed with fragrant herbs and spices, or grilled pork loin also marry perfectly with the wine's luscious flavors.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438573-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":25.0,"score":0.7868421052631579,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Frobert-mondavi-napa-merlot-1999%2F51817"}]},"instructions":"In a small bowl, whisk the lemon juice with the mustard, then slowly whisk in the olive oil.
