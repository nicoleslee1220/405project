Try pairing with Merlot, Pinot Noir, and rosé Wine. Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. One wine you could try is Tinga Rio Reserve Merlot.
