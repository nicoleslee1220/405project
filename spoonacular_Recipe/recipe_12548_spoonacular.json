Buttery chardonnay is great for scallops, shrimp, crab, and lobster, while muscadet is a classic pick for mussels, oysters, and clams. If you've got some spice in your shellfish, a semi-dry riesling can balance out the heat. The 7Cellars Elway's Reserve Chardonnay with a 4.9 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.
