To make the batter:                          Puree the chipotles and egg together in a blender. When well blended transfer to a bowl and whisk in the beer. In a separate mixing bowl combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture, whisking well to prevent clumps. Add freshly ground pepper. Set the batter aside while preparing the other ingredients.                          For the fish tacos:                          In a small mixing bowl mix together the sour cream, 2 tablespoons of the chopped cilantro, 2 tablespoons lime juice and 1 teaspoon gray salt, mix well and remove to a serving bowl.                          In a large pot or skillet add corn oil about 1 to 2-inches deep. Over medium heat, heat the corn oil to 350 degrees F.                          On a large serving plate arrange the tomatoes, lime wedges, chopped cilantro, and sliced radishes to garnish tacos.                          Wrap the tortillas in aluminum foil and heat in the oven while frying the fish.                          With your fingers dip the fish strips into the batter and carefully place in the hot oil. Fry until golden brown all over, about 2 minutes on each side. With a slotted spoon remove the fish to a paper towel. To assemble the tacos place 1 piece of the fried fish on a warm tortilla and garnish with tomatoes, chopped cilantro, radishes, and sour cream. Serve with lime wedges and Todd's Slaw.                          Core the cabbage and shave thinly. Peel the red onion, cut in half, and slice thin and mix well with the cabbage.                          Boil the cider vinegar and sugar together whisking to dissolve sugar. When hot combine with olive oil, caraway seeds, salt and pepper. Place cabbage and onions in a non-reactive baking dish and pour hot dressing over the top. Place another pan of equal size on top and place a weight on top to press the slaw. Refrigerate for 24 hours. Before serving add chopped scallions.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":300.0,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]}]},{"name":"To make the batter","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Puree the chipotles and egg together in a blender.
