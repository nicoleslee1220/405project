Place them into a blender with 1/4 cup of water and blend until smooth. Place pulp into a fine mesh strainer over a bowl to catch the juice. Press the blended carrot with the back of a wooden spoon to squeeze the juice from the pulp until you have 1/3 cup of juice.Using an immersion blender, add all sauce ingredients into a tall bowl but leaving out the scallion. Blend on low until miso is completely dissolved. Pour into 4 serving dishes for dipping and add the scallions equally in each dish.Pan-Seared Tuna InstructionsIngredients1/8 Cup wasabi coated sesame seeds1 pound sushi-grade yellowfin tuna2 tablespoon safflower oil1 tablespoon sesame oilDirectionsSpread sesame seeds thinly over a small plate.
