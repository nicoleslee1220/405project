Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Jean Biecher Pinot Gris. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":2045398,"title":"Jean Biecher Pinot Gris","description":"This Pinot Gris has a beautiful yellow-gold color. Rich in aromatic complexity, Pinot Gris can reveal typically smoky notes as well as delicious aromas of dried fruit, apricot, honey, beeswax and gingerbread. This ample and fleshy wine is sustained by a delightful tension which gives the wine a full-bodied structure. The finish is long and well balanced.ave a noble, velvety texture sometimes with smooth and silky nuances.\nWith its richness of expression, Pinot Gris sports a natural audacity, able to be matched with dishes usually for red wines.
