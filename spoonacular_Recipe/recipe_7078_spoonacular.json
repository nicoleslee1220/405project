Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Jean Biecher Pinot Gris with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":2045398,"title":"Jean Biecher Pinot Gris","description":"This Pinot Gris has a beautiful yellow-gold color. Rich in aromatic complexity, Pinot Gris can reveal typically smoky notes as well as delicious aromas of dried fruit, apricot, honey, beeswax and gingerbread. This ample and fleshy wine is sustained by a delightful tension which gives the wine a full-bodied structure. The finish is long and well balanced.ave a noble, velvety texture sometimes with smooth and silky nuances.\nWith its richness of expression, Pinot Gris sports a natural audacity, able to be matched with dishes usually for red wines. With its hint of earthy and smoky undergrowth, Pinot Gris d’Alsace makes an admirable match for pan-fried girolle mushrooms, risotto with boletus mushrooms.","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/2045398-312x231.jpg","averageRating":1.0,"ratingCount":8.0,"score":0.96,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fjean-biecher-pinot-gris-2020%2F759987"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 375.Coat the bottom of a baking dish with olive oil.Place the tilapia fillets in the pan.Sprinkle desired amount of garlic salt, cajun seasoning, and pepper over tilapia pieces.Press several sprigs of cilantro on top of each piece.Bake tilapia for 8 to 12 minutes.Enjoy alone or with lemon!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 375.Coat the bottom of a baking dish with olive oil.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404646,"name":"baking pan","localizedName":"baking pan","image":"roasting-pan.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the tilapia fillets in the pan.","ingredients":[{"id":15261,"name":"tilapia fillets","localizedName":"tilapia fillets","image":"raw-tilapia.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Sprinkle desired amount of garlic salt, cajun seasoning, and pepper over tilapia pieces.Press several sprigs of cilantro on top of each piece.","ingredients":[{"id":1032028,"name":"cajun seasoning","localizedName":"cajun seasoning","image":"chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":1062047,"name":"garlic salt","localizedName":"garlic salt","image":"garlic-salt.jpg"},{"id":11165,"name":"cilantro","localizedName":"cilantro","image":"cilantro.png"},{"id":15261,"name":"tilapia","localizedName":"tilapia","image":"raw-tilapia.jpg"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","localizedName":"pepper","image":"pepper.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Bake tilapia for 8 to 12 minutes.Enjoy alone or with lemon!","ingredients":[{"id":15261,"name":"tilapia","localizedName":"tilapia","image":"raw-tilapia.jpg"},{"id":9150,"name":"lemon","localizedName":"lemon","image":"lemon.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}],"length":{"number":8,"unit":"minutes"}}]}],"originalId":null}
