Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Maysaran Arsheen Pinot Gris with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":476600,"title":"Maysara Arsheen Pinot Gris","description":"A bright expression of fruit right up front, greeting your palate with notes of cut grass on a warm day. The wine is anchored by crisp acidity, but not so much as to overpower a fleeting tease of sweetness that leaves you smiling.

Grease a baking pan.                            Wrap each tilapia fillet around 3 spears of asparagus and secure with wooden toothpicks.  Season the fish with salt and pepper, then place in prepared baking pan.  Cover with foil and bake for 10 minutes.                            Remove the foil and sprinkle the chopped green onion over the fish. Return the pan, uncovered, to the oven to bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, or until fish flakes easily with a fork.                            While the fish is baking, heat the wine in a small saucepan over medium heat.  In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch and lemon juice and whisk until there are no visible clumps.  Add the cornstarch mixture to the white wine, cooking and stirring to prevent lumps.  Add the dried basil and black pepper and continue to cook for 2 minutes or until the sauce is thickened.                            To serve, remove the toothpicks from the tilapia fillets and spoon sauce over top.
