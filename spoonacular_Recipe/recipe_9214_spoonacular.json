With motor running, add just enough oil to make a silky paste. Season with salt.                                                                        Make beet salad:                Simmer beets in 3 inches of water in a large saucepan, covered, until tender, about 30 minutes. Cool in liquid, uncovered, about 30 minutes, then peel and cut into 1/2-inch wedges.

Divide almond butter among 6 plates and top with beet salad. Put a bombolone on each salad and sprinkle lightly with sea salt. Serve remaining bomboloni on the side.                                                Cooks' notes:            • Almond butter can be made 3 days ahead and chilled, covered. Bring to room temperature before using.• Beet salad, without chives, can be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring to room temperature and stir in chives before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Make almond butter","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Grind almonds to a paste with garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and cayenne in a food processor.
