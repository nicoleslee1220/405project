Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Loveblock Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":440435,"title":"Loveblock Pinot Gris","description":"Loveblock Pinot Gris is a pale golden with hints of green.
