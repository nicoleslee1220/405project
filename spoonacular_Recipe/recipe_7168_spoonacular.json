To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. One wine you could try is Hindsight Wines Chardonnay. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 26 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":495204,"title":"Hindsight Wines Chardonnay","description":"Our 2018 Chardonnay is sourced from vineyards in Carneros and Oak Knoll.
