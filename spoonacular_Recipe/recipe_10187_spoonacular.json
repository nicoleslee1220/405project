Bring to a vigorous boil; lower to simmer. Skim off foam and impurities; simmer 15 minutes. Remove pot from heat, cover tightly, and leave undisturbed at room temperature for 45 minutes (an instant-read thermometer should read 165F / 74 C at the thickest part of the chicken).\n\nCarefully lift chicken from poaching liquid and plunge into a large container/pot/bowl of ice water. Leave in water for 15 minutes to stop cooking and firm up meat. Using your hands, pull off skin and discard.\n\nPull meat off breast and thighs into 1/4to 1/2-inch (.6 to 1.3 cm.) thick strips, transfer to covered container and reserve at room temperature (you will have more than needed for the recipe).\n\nCombine bones, thighs and poaching liquid back in the pot. Add ginger, onion, garlic, peppercorns and salt; simmer one hour to make a broth. Strain through fine wire mesh sieve. Taste and season well with salt.\n\nFOR THE SOUP GARNISHES\n\nSoak noodles in lukewarm water 10 minutes, drain; peel apart into individual strands. Poach shrimp in chicken broth until just cooked; peel, devein and halve lengthwise. Blanch whole bunches of choy sum in boiling water; transfer to a bowl of ice water for 30 seconds, squeeze dry, and cut into 2 to 3-inch pieces (5 to 7 cm.).\n\nFOR THE CHILI SOY SAUCE\n\nCombine soy sauce, sesame oil and chilies, spoon mixture into individual bowls for each person.\n\nASSEMBLY OF MALAYSIAN CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP BOWLS\n\nBring seasoned broth up to a near boil. Have all ingredients ready, and have a pot of water boiling to reheat the noodles.\n\nReheat noodles in boiling water for 15 seconds. Drain, and distribute into 4 to 6 Asian soup bowls. Top noodles with chicken meat, shrimp, and choy sum. Ladle about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of broth into each bowl.\n\nSprinkle with scallions; serve with small dishes of chili-soy sauce. This sauce is used for dipping the subtly-flavored chicken, but can also be added to the soup.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"FOR THE SOUP AND CHICKEN","ingredients":[{"id":5006,"name":"whole chicken","localizedName":"whole chicken","image":"whole-chicken.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"soup","localizedName":"soup","image":""}],"equipment":[]}]},{"name":"Make Chicken Broth","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place rinsed chicken in 2-gallon pot (8 L.), with just enough water to cover.
