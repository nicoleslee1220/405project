Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Skyfall Pinot Gris with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":445128,"title":"Skyfall Pinot Gris","description":"Pale straw in color with notes of mango, citrus blossom and banana in the nose.

Mix the herbs and lemon zest on a plate. Sprinkle the fillets with 3/4 teaspoon salt and1/4 teaspoon pepper and coat both sides of each fillet with herbs, pressing them on so they adhere.    In a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium heat until hot. Cook the tilapia until the flesh is opaque and just cooked through, about 2 minutes on each side (cut into the thick part of a fillet to check). Serve the tilapia with the lemon quarters, for squeezing at the table. (Note: If youre serving this dish to company, you might want to cut wedges from a lemon that hasnt been zested.)                  nutrition information (per serving):        Size                        :                      based on four servings, Calories                        (kcal):                      195, Fat                        (kcal):                      10, Fat Calories                        (g):                      85, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      2, Protein                        (g):                      26, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      5, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      1, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      1, Sodium                        (g):                      250, Cholesterol                        (g):                      90, Fiber                        (g):                      1,                     Photo: Scott Phillips          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Finely grate the zest from the lemon, then cut the lemon in quarters and set aside.","ingredients":[{"id":9150,"name":"lemon","localizedName":"lemon","image":"lemon.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix the herbs and lemon zest on a plate.","ingredients":[{"id":9156,"name":"lemon zest","localizedName":"lemon zest","image":"zest-lemon.jpg"},{"id":1002044,"name":"herbs","localizedName":"herbs","image":"mixed-fresh-herbs.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Sprinkle the fillets with 3/4 teaspoon salt and1/4 teaspoon pepper and coat both sides of each fillet with herbs, pressing them on so they adhere.
