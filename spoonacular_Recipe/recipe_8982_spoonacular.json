Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"In a small bowl, whisk the olive oil, olives, lemon juice, garlic, thyme, black pepper, and cayenne. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil and cook the cavatelli until al dente. Drain it well and return it to the pan. Add the arugula and the olive-oil mixture, folding gently until the ingredients are combined. Let sit until the arugula has wilted, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle with the ricotta salata just before serving.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Calories                        (kcal):                      800, Fat                        (kcal):                      33, Fat Calories                        (g):                      300, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      11, Protein                        (g):                      24, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      18, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      99, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      3, Sodium                        (g):                      790, Cholesterol                        (g):                      45, Fiber                        (g):                      5,                     Photo: Rita Maas          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small bowl, whisk the olive oil, olives, lemon juice, garlic, thyme, black pepper, and cayenne.
