Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Cut the greens off of the beets. Reserve the greens and trim the beets. Wrap each beet individually in aluminum foil. Place all of the wrapped beets on a rimmed baking sheet and roast until tender all the way through, about 40 minutes (though time will very depending on the size of your beets). Remove beets from oven and set aside to cool completely. If making the tart immediately, leave the oven heat on 375.2. While the beets are roasting, prep the beet greens: holding the stem with one hand, run the fingers of your other hand down the step to remove the tender leafy part from the tough stem. Wash greens and chop. Set aside 1 packed cup and reserve any remaining for another recipe.3. In a medium pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add shallots and saut until soft and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add greens and continue cooking until wilted, about 2 minutes. Set aside until slightly cooled.4. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and, on to it, unroll the the puff pastry dough. Over lap the two piecesone full sized, the other half sizedpressing them together at the seams. Make a rim by folding the edges of the pastry dough in by  inch and pressing down gently. Using a fork, poke holes all over the pastry.5. Stir creme fraiche or sour cream into cooled greens and season with salt and pepper to taste. Unwrap cooled beets and, using your hands or a paring knife, peel the skin off and trim any hard bits. Slice beets into 1/4 slices.6. Top prepared dough with an even layer of greens. Layer thin slices of fennel on top. Nestle beets on top of the fennel, pressing them gently into the dough. Cover the entire area inside the rim with beets. Scatter crumbled feta around the top of the tart and bake until the pastry is puffed and golden brown, about 25 minutes.7. Squeeze juice of 1/2 a lemon and drizzle olive oil over the finished tart. Sprinkle with more salt to taste and fresh thyme. Serve warm.*Note: Reserve some of the plain roasted beets and puree with (pasteurized only) feta cheese or plain yogurt for babies as young as 6 months old. Children 8- to 10-months-old safely managing finger foods can share this tart as prepared, just cut into age appropriate bite sizes and consider skipping the final sprinkling of salt.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 375 degrees.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Cut the greens off of the beets.
