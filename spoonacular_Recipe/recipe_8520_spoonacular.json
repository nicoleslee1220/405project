Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Mazzei Fonterutoli Chianti Classico with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 32 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":471586,"title":"Mazzei Fonterutoli Chianti Classico","description":"\"Lots of meat, berry and plum character on the nose and palate. Full-bodied, with velvety tannins and a long, rich finish. Decadent style that I like. Serious quality for the vintage. No Castello in 2002, so this was upgraded.\"-Wine SpectatorColor: Deep purplish-red but bright and exceptionally concentrated.Bouquet: Extremely intense and complex with scents of cherries and raspberries accompanied by light toasty and spicy shadings.Flavor: The impact in the mouth is incisive but soft due to a substantial structure of tannins in which those that are soft and well rounded stand out. Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.","price":"$31.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/471586-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":8.0,"score":0.8400000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fmazzei-fonterutoli-chianti-classico-2015%2F348432"}]},"instructions":"Preheat your oven to 400F. Pierce potatoes with a fork a few times and place them on center rack of the oven. You can also use a rimmed pan if you prefer, and bake until very tender, about 50 to 60 minutes. Alternately, place pierced potatoes on a microwave-safe dish and cook on HIGH until very tender, about 10 to 12 minutes in my 1000 watt microwave. Remove from oven or microwave and let sit until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes.Using a paring knife or your fingers, peel skin off potatoesit should pretty much fall off at this point; discard skins.Break cooked potatoes into cubes and place in a potato ricer. Press through into a deep bowl. Repeat with remaining potatoes.Add flour and season with salt. Using your hands, gently knead mixture in the bowl to form a soft dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead another minute until it forms a smooth ball.Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, shape the gnocchi. Start by diving dough into 6 to 8 pieces. Roll each piece into a 3/4-inch thick rope. Cut off 1 1/2-inch pieces. Make grooves in the gnocchi by placing one at a time into the center of your palm and gently rolling over them with a pastry blender. You can alternately use the tines of a fork (see below), which is what I used to do until I had my eureka moment with the pastry blender. It may take a few tries to get it right, and if it doesnt work as desired, leave the gnocchi as istheyll still taste as good without the grooves! Repeat with remaining dough.Salt the boiling water. Add the shaped gnocchi and cook until they rise to the surface of the water, about three minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a deep bowl. Toss with the butter to coat well. Spoon into an oven-proof ceramic or glass baking dish (a pie plate works great). Evenly spoon marinara sauce on top and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
