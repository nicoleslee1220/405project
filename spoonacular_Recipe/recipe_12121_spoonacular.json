These low-tannin, lower alcohol wines will complement the heat in spicy cajun dishes, instead of making your mouth burn more. The Viontan Albarino with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 16 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":452198,"title":"Vionta Albarino","description":"A fine white wine, with notes of yellow and some flashes of golden-green. Prominent features of the bouquet are green apple, banana, kiwi and melon. On the palate, the wine has soft and agreeable acid, giving way to a melange of ripe fruits, peaches, apricot and kiwi. Lees maceration has created a body and structure with great personality. This aromatically-complex Albarino has a long finish with a touch of bittnerness -- a classic characteristic of the varietal. Ideal with fish and shellfish. But, as a wine with great aromatic structure and good acidity, it is also an excellent wine just to share with friends.","price":"$16.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452198-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8400000000000001,"ratingCount":12.0,"score":0.8129729729729731,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fvionta-albarino-2007%2F96177"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"originalId":null}
