Combine the garlic paste, rosemary, 1 tsp. salt, and the pepper in a small bowl. Add just enough oil to turn the spice mixture into a smooth paste, about 1/2 tsp. Rub the paste over the tunait will be sparse. Let the tuna sit at room temperature for about an hour.Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 225F.Measure the thickness of the tuna steaks and add the same depth of oil to a 10-inch straight-sided saut pan. Heat over low heat until the oil reaches 120F, 2 to 3 minutes. Put the tuna steaks in the oil in a single layer and immediately transfer the pan to the oven. Poach until a few small whitish droplets rise to the surface of the tuna and the center of the fish is rosy, 25 minutes.    Make the vinaigrette    While the fish poaches, combine the parsley, capers, olives, garlic, vinegar, and sugar in a blender and blend to a coarse pure. With the motor running, pour the olive oil through the hole in the blenders lid and pure until incorporated. Taste for salt (it may not need any) and set aside.Transfer the tuna to a wire rack to drain for a few minutes. Serve with the vinaigrette spooned over each steak.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Calories                        (kcal):                      500, Fat                        (kcal):                      36, Fat Calories                        (g):                      320, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      6, Protein                        (g):                      40, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      23, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      2, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      5, Sodium                        (g):                      540, Cholesterol                        (g):                      65, Fiber                        (g):                      0,                     Photo: Scott Phillips          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Poach the tuna    Peel and smash the garlic clove and a pinch of salt to a paste, either with a mortar and pestle or by mincing and then mashing it with the side of a chefs knife.","ingredients":[{"id":10211215,"name":"whole garlic cloves","localizedName":"whole garlic cloves","image":"garlic.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":10015121,"name":"tuna","localizedName":"tuna","image":"canned-tuna.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404751,"name":"mortar and pestle","localizedName":"mortar and pestle","image":"mortar-and-pestle.jpg"},{"id":404672,"name":"chefs knife","localizedName":"chefs knife","image":"chefs-knife.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Combine the garlic paste, rosemary, 1 tsp. salt, and the pepper in a small bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":10111215,"name":"garlic paste","localizedName":"garlic paste","image":"garlic-paste.png"},{"id":2036,"name":"rosemary","localizedName":"rosemary","image":"rosemary.jpg"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","localizedName":"pepper","image":"pepper.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add just enough oil to turn the spice mixture into a smooth paste, about 1/2 tsp.
