Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. The Director's Merlot with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 21 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428445,"title":"Director's Merlot","description":"Our 2014 Director's Merlot offers lushness and a round, full palate. Its fragrance demonstrates red and black fruit with hints of anise and spiced wood. Juicy upon entry, the wine broadens and becomes velvety on the palate with flavors of plum, loganberry and black cherry accentuated by subtle spice notes of espresso bean and toasted vanilla. Medium tannins support the body of this wine, offering sophistication in its finish. Pairs nicely with brisket, grilled pork chops and linguine with pesto.","price":"$21.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428445-312x231.jpg","averageRating":1.0,"ratingCount":1.0,"score":0.75,"link":"https://www.amazon.com/2014-Directors-Merlot-750-mL/dp/B073XVS4MB?tag=spoonacular-20"}]},"instructions":"In a medium bowl combine the tuna, onion, parsley, olives.
