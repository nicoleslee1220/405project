To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. One wine you could try is Chateau Ste. Michelle Indian Wells Chardonnay Wine. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428201,"title":"Chateau Ste.
