Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Jean Biecher Pinot Gris with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":2045398,"title":"Jean Biecher Pinot Gris","description":"This Pinot Gris has a beautiful yellow-gold color. Rich in aromatic complexity, Pinot Gris can reveal typically smoky notes as well as delicious aromas of dried fruit, apricot, honey, beeswax and gingerbread. This ample and fleshy wine is sustained by a delightful tension which gives the wine a full-bodied structure. The finish is long and well balanced.ave a noble, velvety texture sometimes with smooth and silky nuances.\nWith its richness of expression, Pinot Gris sports a natural audacity, able to be matched with dishes usually for red wines. With its hint of earthy and smoky undergrowth, Pinot Gris d’Alsace makes an admirable match for pan-fried girolle mushrooms, risotto with boletus mushrooms.","price":"$17.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/2045398-312x231.jpg","averageRating":1.0,"ratingCount":8.0,"score":0.96,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fjean-biecher-pinot-gris-2020%2F759987"}]},"instructions":"Warm up olive oil in a 10\" or 12\" skillet.Mix the corn meal and Old Bay seasoning thoroughly, then spread out on a platter.Coat tilapia fillets lightly, but thoroughly with corn meal and Old Bay mixture.Lay coated fillets in hot olive oil (medium-medium high heat) and cook until golden on the bottom, then turn fillets over and repeat.Do not overcook the fish--it's easy to do.While fillets are cooking, combine Miracle Whip, sweet relish, and lemon juice and stir until well blended, then serve with the fish.It's quick, easy, and doesn't require a lot of cleanup.Steamed carrots or broccoli and some form of potatoes go well with this.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Warm up olive oil in a 10\" or 12\" skillet.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix the corn meal and Old Bay seasoning thoroughly, then spread out on a platter.Coat tilapia fillets lightly, but thoroughly with corn meal and Old Bay mixture.","ingredients":[{"id":1052034,"name":"old bay seasoning","localizedName":"old bay seasoning","image":"seasoning.png"},{"id":15261,"name":"tilapia fillets","localizedName":"tilapia fillets","image":"raw-tilapia.jpg"},{"id":35137,"name":"cornmeal","localizedName":"cornmeal","image":"cornmeal.png"},{"id":0,"name":"spread","localizedName":"spread","image":""}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Lay coated fillets in hot olive oil (medium-medium high heat) and cook until golden on the bottom, then turn fillets over and repeat.Do not overcook the fish--it's easy to do.While fillets are cooking, combine Miracle Whip, sweet relish, and lemon juice and stir until well blended, then serve with the fish.It's quick, easy, and doesn't require a lot of cleanup.Steamed carrots or broccoli and some form of potatoes go well with this.","ingredients":[{"id":4014,"name":"miracle whip","localizedName":"miracle whip","image":"mayonnaise.png"},{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","localizedName":"lemon juice","image":"lemon-juice.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":11090,"name":"broccoli","localizedName":"broccoli","image":"broccoli.jpg"},{"id":11352,"name":"potato","localizedName":"potato","image":"potatoes-yukon-gold.png"},{"id":11124,"name":"carrot","localizedName":"carrot","image":"sliced-carrot.png"},{"id":0,"name":"relish","localizedName":"relish","image":""},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]}],"originalId":null}
