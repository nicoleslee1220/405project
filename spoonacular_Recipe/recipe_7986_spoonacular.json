Rub wasabi marinade into tuna steaks, then cover with plastic (or place in resealable plastic bag) and refrigerate 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.                                                                            Preheat oven to 350F.                                                                            Cut thin slice from stem end of each tomato and set tops aside.                                                                            Bring large saucepan water to boil. Add tomato bottoms and boil, uncovered, until warm and starting to soften, about 1 minute. Drain.                                                                            Using small spoon, scoop out and discard seeds and pulp from tomatoes. Sprinkle tomato cavities with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Set aside.                                                                            Slice each pita bread crosswise into 2 round halves and transfer to baking sheet.

In large skillet or wok over moderate heat, heat sesame oil until hot but not smoking.
