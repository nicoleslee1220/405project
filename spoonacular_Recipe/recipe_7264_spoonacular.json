In the bowl of a food processor, combine the yolks, mayo, Dijon, salt, lemon juice, and smoked trout, and process until the mixture is smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides as needed.

Scrape the yolk mixture into a pastry bag (or a zip-top plastic bag with a corner cut off) and pipe the mixture into the egg white halves.  Garnish with fresh herbs just before serving.                                  Place eggs into a pot and cover them with cold water, cover and bring to a boil. Allow the eggs to boil for one minute, turn off the heat and let the eggs sit in the hot water for 10 minutes. Drain the eggs and plunge them into an ice bath until they are cooled. The eggs are ready to use immediately or can be refrigerated for up to one week.  Note: this works best with eggs that have a bit of age on them  ultra-fresh eggs like the ones we get from our farmers market dont peel well, so I usually buy eggs for boiling a couple of weeks in advance.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut the eggs in half lengthwise, remove the yolks, and set the egg whites aside.","ingredients":[{"id":1124,"name":"egg whites","localizedName":"egg whites","image":"egg-white.jpg"},{"id":1125,"name":"egg yolk","localizedName":"egg yolk","image":"egg-yolk.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","localizedName":"egg","image":"egg.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"In the bowl of a food processor, combine the yolks, mayo, Dijon, salt, lemon juice, and smoked trout, and process until the mixture is smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides as needed.
