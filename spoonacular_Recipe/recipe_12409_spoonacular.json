Add tomato paste and curry powder, and stir 1 minute longer.                                                                                                 Add squash, apples, broth, 4 cups water, ginger, bay leaf, cloves, and pepper. Stirring often, bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until squash mashes easily, 30 to 40 minutes.
