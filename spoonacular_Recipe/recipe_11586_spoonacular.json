Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"If using Hokkien noodles, rinse with warm water; set aside. If using Chinese-style egg noodles, bring a large pot three-fourths full of water to a boil over high heat.

Drain, rinse thoroughly with cold running water and drain again; set aside.In a nonstick wok over high heat, warm 2 Tbs. of the oil.

Add the tomatoes and potato, and toss and stir, being careful not to break up the cubes, until heated, 1 to 2 minutes.
