Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon to a paper towel lined plate to drain. Generously salt and pepper the chicken thighs and place in the hot pan, skin side down. Leave undisturbed for 6-7 minutes or until skin is golden brown, then flip allowing to brown lightly on the second side. Transfer to plate.Remove 2 Tbs of fat from the pan and set aside in a small bowl. Add the onion, celery and garlic and saute until soft, scrapping the fond off the bottom of the pan so it doesnt burn. Deglaze the pan using the cognac. Allow most of the liquid to evaporate, then add the red wine, chicken stock, bay leaf, thyme, and tomato paste. Return the bacon and chicken to the pan and turn several times to make sure they are well coated and submerged in the liquid. Cover with the lid slightly askew (so steam can escape) and simmer over medium low heat until the chicken is tender 35-45 minutes.Add 2 Tbs flour to the fat youve reserved and stir until there are no lumps. When the chicken is tender, transfer to a plate and tent with foil. Add the mushrooms and onions to the pan and turn up the heat to medium, simmering uncovered for about 15 minutes or until the onions are cooked and the sauce has reduced a bit. Add a few tablespoons of sauce to the fat/flour mixture and stir to make a slurry. Add the slurry to the sauce in the pan one spoonful at a time, mixing well after each addition to make sure there are no lumps. I dont like my sauce too thick, so I stopped about 2/3 of the way through, but if you like a very thick sauce, you can add all the roux. Salt and pepper to taste, then add the chocolate and stir vigorously to melt the chocolate into the braising liquid. Return the chicken to to pot to reheat and coat with the sauce.Serve over mashed potatoes, egg noodles, or as a stew with a crusty baguette. Plate the Choc au Vin and sprinkle some smoked sea salt and parsley on top to garnish.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large chefs pan or dutch oven, fry the bacon over medium heat until most of the fat has rendered out (but not until the bacon is crisp).","ingredients":[{"id":10123,"name":"bacon","localizedName":"bacon","image":"raw-bacon.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404667,"name":"dutch oven","localizedName":"dutch oven","image":"dutch-oven.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon to a paper towel lined plate to drain.
