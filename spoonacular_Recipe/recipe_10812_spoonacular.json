Fill a large pot 3/4 of the way with water and add 1 teaspoon of salt and the Brussels sprouts. Put the pot over high heat and bring to a boil. Let boil until the Brussels sprouts are just fork tender about, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, drain the sprouts and transfer to an ice bath. Let cool completely, then drain and set aside.                          Cut the Brussels sprouts into 1/4-inch lengthwise slices and set aside. Add the bacon to a medium saute pan, and cook until just crisp, then remove to a paper towel lined plate to drain. Adjust heat to medium-high, add the onions to the pan and saute until they are translucent and just beginning to caramelize, about 5 or 6 minutes. Add the butter to the pan, then add the Brussels sprouts and saute for 3 to 4 more minutes. Season with the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper. Transfer to a serving bowl or platter and sprinkle with the reserved bacon and the cheese. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Fill a large pot 3/4 of the way with water and add 1 teaspoon of salt and the Brussels sprouts.","ingredients":[{"id":11098,"name":"brussels sprouts","localizedName":"brussels sprouts","image":"brussels-sprouts.jpg"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","localizedName":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Put the pot over high heat and bring to a boil.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","localizedName":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Let boil until the Brussels sprouts are just fork tender about, 8 to 10 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11098,"name":"brussels sprouts","localizedName":"brussels sprouts","image":"brussels-sprouts.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":8,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":5,"step":"Remove from the heat, drain the sprouts and transfer to an ice bath.","ingredients":[{"id":11001,"name":"sprouts","localizedName":"sprouts","image":"alfalfa-sprouts.png"},{"id":10014412,"name":"ice","localizedName":"ice","image":"ice-cubes.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":6,"step":"Let cool completely, then drain and set aside.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":7,"step":"Cut the Brussels sprouts into 1/4-inch lengthwise slices and set aside.","ingredients":[{"id":11098,"name":"brussels sprouts","localizedName":"brussels sprouts","image":"brussels-sprouts.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":8,"step":"Add the bacon to a medium saute pan, and cook until just crisp, then remove to a paper towel lined plate to drain.
