The palate shows surprising structure and a dry finish. The grapes were very healthy, so the fermentation was steady and almost complete, which suits this style of Gewurztraminer. It is already quite open but will benefit from a little time in the bottle. \n\nThis style of Gewurztraminer will be perfect with grilled fish or white meat, go very well with smoked food, Asian recipes and anything that could be complicated with wines.","price":"$26.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/435235-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9199999999999999,"ratingCount":8.0,"score":0.8799999999999999,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fzind-humbrecht-gewurztraminer-2011%2F122031"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"originalId":null}
