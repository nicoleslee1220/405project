Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr√ºner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Zind-Humbrecht Clos Windsbuhl Vendange Tardive Pinot Gris. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 99 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":494626,"title":"Zind-Humbrecht Clos Windsbuhl Vendange Tardive Pinot Gris","description":"","price":"$99.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/494626-312x231.jpg","averageRating":1.0,"ratingCount":6.0,"score":0.9473684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fzind-humbrecht-clos-windsbuhl-vendange-tardive-pinot-gris-2005%2F322199"}]},"instructions":"In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat.Add onion, garlic and ginger, saute about 3 minutes.Add teriyaki sauce and honey; bring to a boil, stirring constantly.Simmer about 2 minutes.Allow to cool to room temperature.In a small dish reserve 1/4 cup sauce for basting, cover and place in fridge.Put the fish steaks in a large resealable plastic bag and pour remaining sauce over them.Put the fish in fridge and marinate 2 to 3 hours.Preheat the grill for 5 minutes.Spray both sides of grill with non-stick cooking spray.Grill fish steaks for 4 minutes or until almost half done.Open grill and remove steaks; wipe grill clean and spray both sides again with non-stick cooking spray.Return the steaks to the grill and baste with the reserved 1/4 cup sauce.Grill 3 more minutes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","localizedName":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","localizedName":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add onion, garlic and ginger, saute about 3 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","localizedName":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":11216,"name":"ginger","localizedName":"ginger","image":"ginger.png"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","localizedName":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add teriyaki sauce and honey; bring to a boil, stirring constantly.Simmer about 2 minutes.Allow to cool to room temperature.In a small dish reserve 1/4 cup sauce for basting, cover and place in fridge.","ingredients":[{"id":6112,"name":"teriyaki sauce","localizedName":"teriyaki sauce","image":"dark-sauce.jpg"},{"id":19296,"name":"honey","localizedName":"honey","image":"honey.png"},{"id":0,"name":"sauce","localizedName":"sauce","image":""}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Put the fish steaks in a large resealable plastic bag and pour remaining sauce over them.","ingredients":[{"id":23232,"name":"steak","localizedName":"steak","image":"ribeye-raw.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"sauce","localizedName":"sauce","image":""},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":221671,"name":"ziploc bags","localizedName":"ziploc bags","image":"plastic-bag.jpg"}]},{"number":5,"step":"Put the fish in fridge and marinate 2 to 3 hours.Preheat the grill for 5 minutes.Spray both sides of grill with non-stick cooking spray.Grill fish steaks for 4 minutes or until almost half done.Open grill and remove steaks; wipe grill clean and spray both sides again with non-stick cooking spray.Return the steaks to the grill and baste with the reserved 1/4 cup sauce.Grill 3 more minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":4679,"name":"cooking spray","localizedName":"cooking spray","image":"cooking-spray.png"},{"id":23232,"name":"steak","localizedName":"steak","image":"ribeye-raw.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"sauce","localizedName":"sauce","image":""},{"id":10115261,"name":"fish","localizedName":"fish","image":"fish-fillet.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404706,"name":"grill","localizedName":"grill","image":"grill.jpg"}],"length":{"number":192,"unit":"minutes"}}]}],"originalId":null}
